AMPHIPODA SYNOPIDEA. 17

Τ116 body is not very arched, almost straight.

The head is triangular seen from above, but nearly rectangular
seen from the side, a little 81101161 than the first four pereional seg-
ments. The excavation for the insertion of the antennae is very large,
deeper than half the depth of the head.

The median eye. is very broad, not circular; the number of peri-
pherical ocelli is about thirty, those of the hinder margin are indistinct.
The small secondary eyes are situated very close to the median eye.

The first pair of anteomae [Pl. H, fig. 23] reach quite to the anterior
margin 01 1116 second pleonal segment. The last joint 01 1116 peduncle is
scarcely as long as a third of the second. The flagellum consists of 16
joints, the first much the longest, as long as the four following ones to—
gether, 136861 with long hairs3 the following are totally smooth, except
the last, which carries a long terminal hair. The secondary flagellum
is two-jointed, shorter than the first joint of 1116 11116 flagellum.

The second pair of antennae [Pl. Π, fig. 24] are similar in struc-
ture to 111086 of S. ultramarina, but the articuli of the flagellum 316
longer and more setose.

The pereion. The fifth and sixth segments are equal, the seventh
the longest. as long as the first two together.

The epimerals [Pl. II, fig. 22] resemble very closely those of S.
ultramarina.

The first pair of pereiopoda [Pl. Π, fig. 25] differ from the same
pair in S. ultramarina only in very unimportant details, as the carpus
being proportionally longer, the plumose hairs also longer, as long as
the breadth 01 1116 joint, and the dactylus shorter, equalling only two
thirds of the length 01 1116 metacarpus.

The second pair [Pl. II, fig. 26] are of the same form as in S.
ultramarina, the bristles of the carpus and metacarpus are a little longer
and stronger.

The third pair [Pl. ΙΙ, fig. 27]. The femur is 81101161· than thc epi-
meral is deep. The tibia is longer than the carpus3 the tibia and car-
pus together are longer than the femur. The anterior margin of the
tibia is fringed with minute hairs.

The fourth pair [Pl. II, fig. 28]. The carpus is almost twice 38
long as broad; both tibia and carpus are filled with a glandular mass,
a little of which 18 10 be seen also in the metacai·puS. The metacarpus
is half as long as the carpiiS, the hindei· margin fringed with -10—12
very long, plumose hairs, longer than the joint itself.
