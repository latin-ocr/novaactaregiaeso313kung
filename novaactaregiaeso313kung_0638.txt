Diagn. Caput eum rostro segmento primo pereii brevius.

Aulemzae primi paris flagello decem-articulato, articulo primo sequentibus lon-
gitudine aequante. Flagellum secundarium tri—articulatum.

Genu paris secundi pedam perezii perlongum, longitudine carpum superans;
dactylo minimo. Tibia paris quarti longitudinem femoris aequans.

Epe'mera segmentorum secundi, tertii et quarti permagna, epiinerum segmenti
secundi maximum, triangulatum. ⁷

Pedes uri secundi paris apicem ultimi paris attingentes.

Telson rotundatum, pedunculo pedum uri⁴ ultimi paris longius.

The head with the rostrum shorter than the first pereional segment.
The flagellum of the first pair of antennae ten—jointed‚ the first
joint as long as the following together. The second-ary flagellum is

three-jointed.

The genu of the second pair of pereiopoda 16 very long, longer
than the carpus3 the dactylus is very small. The tibia of the fourth

pair equals the length of the femur.

The epimerals of the second, third7 and fourth segments are very
large⁷ that of the second segment is the largest, triangular.

The second pair of uropocla reach to the end of the third pair.

The telson is rounded, longer than the peduncle of the last pair
of uropoda.

The description of BOEcK is not quite accurate; it seems that he
has taken some characteristics from the adult animal and others from
very young ones; the drawings given by him do not always agree with
1116 ᾶ66611ρ11011; 011 11116 account it seems convenient 10 give here also
figures of some details of a younger specimen for comparison With the
same organs in the adult animal. The specimens described here were
taken by me at »Tj6tt6>)‚ Northern Nonvay, from a depth of 80 fathoms
July 1871, and in »Hei-danger [ici-d» south-western coast of Norway‚
July 1880.
