—The plane of the op‘sical axes is, as on the lanthanite, parallel

to 00P00. One of ‘she bisectrices of the optical axes goes out on the
basio plane.

Carbonate of didymium and potassium
DiKssCQ -l- 6H2O.

On mixing a solution of acetate of didymium with an excess of
biearbonate of-potassium a gelatinous and bulky precipitate was thrown
down. It was left in the liquid for some time and had then changed
into brillant lilae-ooloured needles. The salt was pressed between filter-
paper and subjeeted to the following analyses:

O.77·21 gram lost by 110⁰ 0201ss gram H2O.
O.837·2 gram gave O.3376 gram Di208 and O.1597 gram KCl.

0.Βὸδὲ gram gave O.3457 gram Di203 ancl 01653 gram KOl.
