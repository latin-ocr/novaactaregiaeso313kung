and a part of the pereion into a hyaline bell or globe. The interior vof
this globe consists of a liquid matter, enclosed in a thin, pellucid 1110111-
brane. As all the specimens Ι have examined were, since a longer or
shorter time, preserved in alcohol, it was impossible to determine if the
fluid is specific or the same as the surronnding medium. It was also
quite impossible 10 perce-ive any connection between this bladder or
water-roem with the organs of circulation and digestion, or any connection
between it and the surrounding medium. How the fiuid originates and
is maintained in the bladder, is a riddle, probably not 10 be solved be-
fore fresh specimens of the animal 0311 be examined.

From the ganglia in the second, third, and fourth pereional seg-
ments fine nerves go up 10 1110 wall of the bladder. where they spread

gument of the body, the vegetative organs are placed.

two anterior lobes are bent backwards, and attenuated into a stout, serni-
circularly bent nerve on each side3 these nerves end, 3 little swollen,
in the basal joints of the npper antennae. From this point the nerve is
divided into delicate fibres, passing into 3 soft glandular substance, which
almost fills not only the joints of the peduncle, but also the very long
and 310111 basal joint of the flagellum. This glandular mass is fimbriated
cor-responding to the serratures at the margins of the joint. Such long
fimbriae run also into the three short terminal joints of the flagellum.
From the median lobes of the cephalic ganglion issue the slender nerves
for the second pair of antennae.
