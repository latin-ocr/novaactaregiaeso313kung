It is to be assumed that a part of the water found consisted of
only hygrosoopio moisture, so that the amount of Wa²ser given in the
above formula must not by any means be regarded as exact.

Succinate of samarium

811123O2H4OEO2>2÷5H2O (at 1000 dried 3H2O).

On adding a solution of suooinio aoid to a solution, of the aee-
* tate of samarium, no precipitate is formed at the ordinary temperatum,
but, on war-ming⁷ a oopious white mioroorystalline powder is thrown down.
The suocinate is very sparingly soluble in water. It is deoomposed on
heating and leaves a very voluminous oxide of samarium. The salt lo-
ses at 1000 567 peroent, corresponding to 2 mol. H2O <calc 488).

O.4333 gram salt, dried at 100⁰, gave on ignition 0.2161 gr. Sm2O3.

In percent: 49.87 Sln2O3. Oaloulated from the formula with .
3H2Ot49.57.

Tartrate of samarium
Sm23C2H2(OH2)2-l-6 (dried at 100Ο 2) H2O.

A solution of tartaric aoid gives with acetate of samarium a white
bulky precipitem, which, on warming, changes into a heavy, granula,
non orystalline powder. Very little samarium remains in the, solu-
tion. The tartrate, when reeently prepared, is soluble in oaust-ie ammonia,
but the solution deposits after some time, or immediately on boiling, a
white powder. The salt pressed between filter-paper lost at 100⁰ 8-67
peroen†¹ H2O or 4 mol. (cale 8.45).

O.4602 gram salt, dried at 100⁰, gave on ignition O.2067 gr. Sm203.

In peroent: 4492 Sm2O3‚ and the formula with 2H2O requires
4461 peroent Sm203.
