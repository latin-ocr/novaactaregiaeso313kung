ganglion, the two ganglia of each pair are fused together or coalesced3
the commissural cords are still separated and well developed. The third
pleonal ganglion is the biggest, nearly twice as large as the preceding,
and probably composed of the last pleonal and all ural ganglia. It
supplies the last pleopoda and the whole urus with nerves. Four pairs
of strong nerves issue from it, the hindermost run to the anal orifice.

The second to sixth pereional segments carry branclzz‘al sacks,
ovate, very long, filled with a fibrous matter. They are fixed on the
under—side of the epimeral behind the point of articulation of the femur.

A little before the same point the ovz'gyerous lamellae or ovitectri-
ces 616 fixed, but only on the second, third, fourth, and fifth segments.
These lamellae are uncommonly long, fringed with long straight fila-
ments. Those of the second segment are as long as the corresponding
legs themselves, those of the third and fourth pair only a little shorter.

In one specimen only Ι was able 10 see 1116 ovaria as long, thin,
flattened bodies, situated in the second, third, and fourth segments, close
to the upper side of the digest-ive canal. An oviduct was not 10 106 de-
tected. The testes could not be observed, which was not unexspected,
as the only male specimen I got of Mimonectes Loveni was very young,
and not in the best condition, having been preserved in alcohol for more
than twenty five years.

The z'nteyumem of the body is transparent, especially on the globe.
It is formed of large hexagonal plateS, easily to be recognized on the
head and some 011161 places.

The head is nearly four times higher than long, very broad,
forming the forepart of the globe. Through the hyaline integument 1116
cephalic ganglion as well as the mouth-organs is to be seen.

The eyes do not form a continuous mass on each side of the
head as in the other Hyperids, but consist of 8—10 large ocelli, scat-
tered over the lower side of the head. These do not show such long
crystallic elements as in Phronima, Rhabdosoma, and others, but seem
to be composed each of a great many granular, fine, light-breaking
corpuscles interspersed with dark-brown pigment.

The upper antennae [Pl. I. fig. 2] consist of two-jointed pedun-
cles. The basal joint is very stout andv thick [coalesced of the two
first]; the second [viz. the third] is short, not equalling a fourth of the
preceding; the stout, straight flagellum issues from it. The flagellum
is four—jointed; the first joint is more than twice longer than the pe-
duncle, serrated at the upper margin and ending in a strong double-
