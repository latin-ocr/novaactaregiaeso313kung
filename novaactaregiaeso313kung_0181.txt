Oxalate of samarium

Sm23O2O4 -1- 10 H2O.

On adding a solution of oxalio aeid to solutions of the salts of
samarium, bulky, white, and oaseous precipitates are thrown down which
soon become heavy and crystalline. Oxalate of samarium is soluble in
concentrated nitrio aoid. At 110⁰ it loses 6H2O.

1-0029 gram gave by ignition O.4638 gram Sm203.

In percont: 46.25 Sm2O3; calo 46.77.

Oxalate of samarium and potassium
KSm2C2O4 -Ι- 2(¹l2?)H2O.

A solution of the nitrate of samarium gave with an excess of
neutral oxalate of potassium a white amorphous precipitate. Only a very
small quantity remained in the solution· The salt was simply pressed
between filter paper of then analysed.

O.7401 gram lost 0.0721 gramngO at 125ο and at 190⁰ an addi-
tional 0.0085 gram, or total 0080ss gram H2O. From the same qvantity
O.3063 gram Sm2O3 and O.1345 gram KGl were obtained.
