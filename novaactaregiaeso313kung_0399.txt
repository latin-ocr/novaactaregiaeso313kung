In the year 18741) Ι published an account of an examinatior] of didy-
mium, free from all the other allied metals known at that time. Later
on, however, it was found that didymium is accompanied by another
metal, samarium. It is evident from the atomio weight of didymium,
147, as determined by me in 1874, as well as from the spectrum of didy-
mium, mapped by THALENV‘J), that my didymium of 1874 was a mixture of
the true didymium with samarium. My later determinatffins, in 18833),
of the atomio weight of didyminm, free fron] samarium, gave the much
lower number 1423. It was therefore indispensible to repeat my for-
mer researches, and another reason for doing so was that Ι wished to
determine the specific gravities os the pure didymium-compounds in
order to be able to compare them with the specific gravities of the
compounds of the other rare earth-metals.

The material for this research was prepared by the method of
partial precipitations of the mixed nitrates of didymium and sama-rium
with cold dilute ammonia. The progress of the separation was tested
by atomio-weight determinatione⁷ and as soon as the didyminm showed
an atomio weight of about 1423 it was regarded as sufficiently pure.

In working out this research I have been assisted by Mr. Gr. W.
PETERssON, assistant in the chemical laboratory of this university.

The specific gravity-determinations were executed exactly in the
manner described in my recent paper on the compounds of samarium.
