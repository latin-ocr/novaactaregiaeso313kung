she following pages cont-ain a resume of my rcsearches on the coni-
pounds of samarium. 1 had also intended to prepare and examine the
metal⁷ but the quantity of pure oxide of saniarium at my disposal was
not sufficient. On completing the separation of the oxides7 which ac-
company the oxide of samarium, Ι expect to obtain ‘a considerable addi-
tional quantity of the latter.

I have endeavoured to determine the specific gravities of the
compounds of samarium7 wherever 1110 properties of 1110 silbstaiices ren-
dered an accurate determination possible. The determinations were all
made in a perfectly nniform manner viz, by weighing in benzo]7 care being
taken in each case to determine the specific gravity of the benzo] and
of the substance at the same temperature. Every determination was
carefully made, and Ι believe therefore that the accur-acy of the results
may be relied upon.

[n the case however of certain anhydrous and very hygroscopic
salts, obtained by hcating the crystallised salte, great accuracy could
not be attained.

In carrying out these researches I have been assisted by Mr.
L. I. ERlKSSON who made several of the analyses and some of the spe-
01110 gravity determinatione, for which I gladly take this opportunity of
thanking him.

The crystalline forms of several of the salts of samarium have
been determined by Mr. HJ. SJOGREN who will publish a more complete
account of his researches later on.

In order to make this paper a complete monograph, I have in-
cluded in 11 1110 most important facts contained in a paper 011 samarium
published by 1110 some time ago¹).
