AMPHIPODA SYNOPIDEA. 15

of antenuae is much deeper. The head is fully as long as the first four
pereional seg-ments.

The large median eya is surrouncled by 20 ocelli in zm unbroken
circle. The secondary eyes are separated from the median one by a
longer distance than in the other species.

The first joint of the first pair of autenm& is almost globulum the
second narrOW, linear, scarcely half as long as the first, the third a
little longer. The flagellum consists of five joints, the first much the
longest, all richly provided with long hairs. The secondury flagellum
is two—jointed.

The second pair of antennae Were broken off.

The μετείθη. The first four segments are equal, the last three a
little longer, equal.

The epimerals of the first and second segments are deeper than
long3 the following could not be examined.

The pereiopocla, as far as it could be ascertained, are very similar
to those of S. ultramarina, differing only in the form of the femora of
the last three pairs, and in the length of the fifth pair.

The pleon. The first segment is a little longer than the second⁷
the pleon is exactly as long as the pereion.

The pleopoda. The peduncles are shorter than the flagella.

The urus is as long as the first four pereional segments. The
last segment is longer than the second.

The first pair of uropoda reach almost to the apex of the last pair.

The telson is a little longer than the peduncle of the last pair of
uropoda, equalling the last ural segment in length. The fissure is
scarcely a third of the length of the telson.

Colour. White, with a few recl spots at the lower ends of the
pereional segments.
