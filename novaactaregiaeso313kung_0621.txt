AMPHIPODA SYNOPIDEA. 7

Segmentum primum peresi secundo longius, segmentum sextum septimo lon-
gius, omnium longissinnnn.

Femora parium quinti ot sexti [mlum peresi rotund-ata, fere circularia, Pedes
septimi paris illis sexti breviores.

Pedunculi pedum ples elliptiei.

Segmentnm primum mv' sefflindo paulo hmgius.

Rami paris ultimi pedum nri longitndine inaequales, parte inferiore solum
marginis interioris setis instructa.

Telson triangulare, apice truncato.

The head is triangular, as broad as long.

There is a small secandam eye on each side, at the bases of the
first pair of antennae.

The first pair of antemna are much shorter than the pereion;
the secondary flagellum as long as or longer than the first joint of the
true flagellum.

The first segment of the perenm is longer than the second; the
sixth is longer than the seventh, being the longest of all.

The femora of the fifth and sixth pairs of pereiopoda are rounded,
nearly circular. The seventh pair are shorter than the sixth.

The peduncles of the pleopoda are elliptical.

The first urat segment is only a little longer than the second.

The rami of the last pair of uropoda are unequal in length, with
the lower part only os the inner margin provided with hairs.

The telson is triangular, truncated at the hinder end.

There are some details in the drawings, given by Dana, which do
not agree with mine, but I think it best to try to identify my specimens
with the species of Dana, because in my opinion they agree in the
more essentia] characteristics.

The body is strongly arched, With a thin hyaline integument, and
agrees well in general habitus with the figure of Dana’s S. ultramarina.

The head is triangular, seen from 1118 side, even as from above,
with two slight excavations for the insertion of the antennae. It is smaller
than in the following species, a little shorter than the first three pereio-
nal segments, not deeper than the pereion.

The median eye 18 round, composed of large ocelli, provided with
distinct light-breaking elements. The number of peripherical ocelli is
about twenty-four, not very distinct at the hinder margin. Over the bases
of the first pair of antennae there is on each side a little secondary
