The differences between the numbres found by analysis and those
calculated from 1116 formulae are considerable, but one could 1101 expect
better from a substance such as 1116 amorphous phosphate‚ 1116 compo-
sition of which may vary. ln any case the composition indicates that
1116 precipitate which di-sodium-orthophosphate gives with salts of sa-
marium is principally composed of trimetallic phosphate.

Pyrophosphate of samarium

{Im } 04, ΡΞΟ3 ÷ 3¹J2H20.
Pyrophosphoric acid easily dissolves 1116 hydrate of samarium,
and the solution deposits after some time, on spontaneous evaporation,

small compact granules of densely crowded crystals. The salt loses at
100⁰ 1079 percent H2O‚ corresponding to 2 mol. H2o (calc. 928 percent).

O.4456 gram salt, pressed between filter—paper‚ lost on ignition
0.o8oo gram H2O. -

O.4118 gram was dissolved in nitric aeid, and 1116 solution boiled.
On adding oxalic aeid O.1852 gram 8111203 was thrown down as oxalate.
From the filtrate 02348 gram Mg2P2O7 was obtained.
