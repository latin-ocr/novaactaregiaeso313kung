HISTORY.

The first indicatione of 1110 existence of samarium date back to ι
1110 year 1878 when DELAFONTAINE¹) 111 examining impure didymi-a, extra· 1
ted from sammskite'7 Observed 801110 new absorption-bands whieh he aseri-
bed 10 a new 11101011, having an atomio weight of 106, assuming the oxide

, to have the formula RO or 159 if R2 O3 110 the correct formula. He

named 1110 new metal (1001010111.

Some 111110 10101 Lmo<2nhsso1S13mD1m> found also 111 sunarskife
an oxide 1110 solutions of which were chwmetfflised by 11 peculial ab·
sorption 111101 01111881011 spectrum. He succeeded 111 separating 11118 οΧ1ᾶο
from didymia by means ef repeated fractional precipitations of 1110 mixed
nitra'tes by 01111110 ammonia. He called the metallie mdical samarium.
111 1880 ΒΕιΑΡΟΝΤΑΙΝΕ3> puhlished 801110 researches 011 1110 compounds
of decipiam 1110 atomio weigh‘t, of which he 11011] found 10 be 114 or 171
according-as 1110 formula of 1110 oxide be taken as DpO 01· Dp203. He
found 1110 sulphate 10 be much less soluble thau 1110 8111111111ῒο of didy-
mium. The salts were colourless. Shortlyafter this MARIGNAC4) published
a paper 011 the sanmrskite earths. By taking advantage os 1110 different
solubilities of 1110 sulphates 111 a saturated solution of pot-assium sul-
phate, he sueoeeded in separating two exides which he designated pro-
visionally as Ya and Ysw'. The atomio weight of 1110 met-allio radica] of
Ysj' was 99.ss 01· 1494 according 10 the formula assumed for 1110 oxide.
The salts were yellow and gave 1110 absorption—speetrum 11181. observed
by DELAFONTMNE and more aeeurately describedby LECOQ DE 1301SBAU-
DRAN. The 011101· (mide, Ya, obtained by MARIGNA'C was white and gave
eolourless salts having no absorphen-spectrum. The salphate formed
with potassium sulphate a double salt soluble 111 ‘a saturated 8011111011 of
pot-assium Fsulphate, a quantity of 11118 double salt oorresponding 10 1
gram of 1110 oxide dissolving 111 100-15000 of the potassium sulphate
solution. The corresponding double sulphate onsff was much less 80101110, ’
while that of 1110 terbia was more soluble. The atomio weight- of the

metallio radic-<11 of Ya was estimated 10 be as a minimum 1045
<or 156. 75).
