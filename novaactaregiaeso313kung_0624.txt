the segment) trnncate7 and the hindei· margin excavate. At the inside of
the upper corner is a tuberculous prominence, against which the Upper
end of the femur articulates3 the epimeral 15 as deep as the length of
the femur of the correspondent leg7 quite as large as the femur of the
fifth pair. The epimerals of the fourth segment are scarcely as long
as the segmenti [Pl. Ι, fig. 14]7 deeper than long, the anterior margin
ronnded⁷ the posterior straight3 at the middle of the npper margin
there is on the inside of the epimeral a tnbercnlar projection for the arti—
cnlation with the leg. The epimeral reaches as far down as half the
length of its femur7 and is partly concealed by the femur of the fifth
pair of pereiopoda. The epimerals of the fifth and sixth segments are
longer than the segments7 ronnded at both ends7 more than twice longer
than deep3 the posterior portion is a little deeper than the anterior.
The last epimerals are shorter than the segment and smaller than the
preceding, but of the same form. [Pl. I, fig. 17].

The bsranclesz'al sczclcs are fixed at the bases of all the pereiopoda
with the exception of the first pair. Those of the second to fourth seg-
ments [Pl. Ι, fig. 14] are longer than the corresponding femora and
very 11185, the following [Pl. Ι fig 15 and 16] equa] the length ot the
femora and are 111015 slender.

The ovitectvzces [Pl. Ι, fig. 18] are attached to the bases of the
second to sixth pairs of pei⁴eiopoda3 they are long7 narrow laminae, a
little broader at the lower ends7 feebly hent inwards. They carry 8—12
10118, simple hairs around the lower ends. They are a little shorter than
the corresponding branchia] sacks.

The first pair (ἥρω-6102100161 [Pl. Ι, fig. 12]. The femur is long
and narrow7 a little broader at the lower end, with two plumose hairs at
the lower anterior corner; the 961111 15 short, the tibia twice longer. The
‹arpus 15 very laige7 d1l rted nearly ovate, more than twice longer than
the two preceding joints together and fiilly as long as the femur. It
carries a single long hair at the lower anterior corner; the hinder mar-
gin 15 nearly semicircular7 bordered with 14 plumose h’airs7 which are as
long as half the breadth of the joint3 at the lower posterior corner
there is a long, plnmose hair7 longer than the metacarpus. The meta-
carpus 15 very dilated7 with the anterior margin feebly, the posterior ,
strongly curved3 it 15 only a third longer than broad. The hindei·
margin is fringed with 14 plumose hairs and, at their bases some
short, simple hairs. At the lower end of the joint aronnd the dactylus
