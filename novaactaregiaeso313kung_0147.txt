SAMAiurn. 3

. The identity of the absorption-bands leads to the conclusion that
decipiuni, samarium, and Ῡβ 311 three contained the same element. But
the atomio weights as deterinined by DELAFONTAINE and by MARIGNAC
diflered greatly.

Later 011 ΒΕιΑΕΟΝΤΑΙΝΕῙ) admitted that his original decipia could
be split up into two different oxides‚ one with an absorption-spectrum
and one without. For the element in the former he adopts the name
samarium reserving the 1131118 decipiuin for the element in the latter.
The respective atoniic weights were 101 (or 151 . 5) and 111 . 3 (or 167).
Th'e Ya of MAR1GNAG he regards as a mixture of terbia and decipia, but
as terbia is orange coloured and Ya ahnost white this supposition
seems to be inadinissible.

SEPARATION.

There is no complete method of separating samaria fron] the
other earths which acconnpany it. In order to remove the ι1111113.-83113118
advantage 1113)ν be taken of the sparing solubility of the double sul-
phate of saniarium and potassiuin in a saturated solution of potassium
sulphate‚ but the most convenient method of separation froin didymia
is by fractional precipitatione of dilate solutions of the nitrates by very
dilute and cold ammonia. Samaria is precipitated first but the operatione
must be repeated a great number of times. In order to obtain 3 pure
oxide it is necessary to combine both inethods. The. sulphate of sa—
marium 18 .inuch less soluble than the sulphate of didyinium, but as
these 83118 are isornorphous7 no good separation can be founded upon
this differenee.

MODE OF OGOURRENOE.

Samarium has been found in Sama-rskite, in Gadolinite, 111 Orthite,
and in Cerite, but there can be no doubt that this 8181118111] will be found
together with didymiuin in 311 minei-als containing the latter metal. Never-
theless seems didyiniuni always to occur 111 greater quantity.
