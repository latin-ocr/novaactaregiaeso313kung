quantities of samaria with sulphuric aoid, Ι obtained as a. mean of six
·experiments the number 150.0:2 (maximum 15O.12‚ minimum 149.94),
assuming for the oxide the formula 8111203. This number agrees as well

as could be desired with MARIGNAc's determination of the atomio weighh

SPECTRUM OF SAMARIUM.

The chloride of samarium gives a spark-spectrum, composed ofa
great number of lines7 for the most part of little intensity. They have
been very carefully mapped by Professer THALEN1) who has registered 198
lines of samarium. A great number of them were formerly attributed to
didymium. Many of the samarium-lines were also observed by ROSCOE
and SCHUsTER2) and by them attributed to ferbium.

The absorpfion-spectrum of samarium has been described by LECOQ
1313 BOISBAUDRAN, by SORET³³), and by THALEN. Their descriptions agree
perfectly and according to them the wave—lengths of the bands are:

559—556 ............. yellow
497—-500 ............. >)
486—472 (strong) ........ blue
466—460 (strong) ........ >>
445—437 (we-ak) ......... ))
419—415 ............. violet ἶ
409—401 (very intense). . . . . )) ⁴

There are also„ according to SORET, sevcral absorption—bands in
the ultra-violet part of the spectrum, the wave-lengths of which are

375—373
364e-360
344

}-}ECQUEREL⁴> also discovered in the infra-red some absorption-bands
with wave-lengths 1145 and 1040.
