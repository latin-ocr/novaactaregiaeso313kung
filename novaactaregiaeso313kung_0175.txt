Molybdate of samarium

Sm2 3 Mo Ο4 .

A neutral solution of the nitrate of samarium gives with an excess
of molybdate of ammonia (6NH4‚ Mo7O24) a voluminous white precipitate
which, if warmed, is changed into a heavy‚ granular, non crystalline
powder. Much samarium remains in solution. As the salt was amor—
phous it was not subjected to analysis. In order to obtain crystallised
molybdate, calculated quantities of molybdic aoid and 0111ᾶο of 031113-
rium (Sm2O3:3MoO3) were mixed with pure chloride of sodium and
heated in a large platinum-crucible for some hours to bright red heat.
After cooling the mass was treated with water, which left izo heavy‚
violet—coloured, very brillant crystals 2εο fine microscopic needles and
3:o brillant scales, resembling boracic acid, insoluble 111 ammonia and
slowly soluble 111 hydrochloric acid; of 3 only 3 0111311 quantity, insuffi-
cient for analysis was obtained. The two other sets of molybdates could
be pretty completely separated by elutriation. The heavy crystals were
neutra] molybdate of samarium and the light needles (2) 3 molybdate os
samarium and sodium.
