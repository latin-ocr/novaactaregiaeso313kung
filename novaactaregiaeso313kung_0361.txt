MmONECTEs, A REMARKABLE GENUS or ABIPHIPODA HYPERIDEA. 7

pointed tooth3 at the under-side it is more coarsely serrated. On the
inner side of the joint is a dense row of olfactory(‘?) hairs. The two
following joints are very short⁷ scarcely equalling a twentieth of the
length of the first, the upper anterior corner ending in a strong tooth
like that of the first joint. [Pl. I. fig. ll]. The fourth or last joint
is longer than both the preceding together, with a feeble tooth at the
upper anterior corner, and a stronger one at the lower3 it carries a
stout bristle. In structure the upper antennae are similar to the same
organs in Tyro 1> and Lanceola.

The lower antemzce [Pl. Ι. fig. 10] are very short. They consist
of four joints; the second joint is the longest. They are fixed at the
middle of the under—side of the head⁷ and carry very feW‚ ‘minute hairs.

Between the base of the upper and the lower antennae is a pro-
tuberance, at the summit of which is a large round hole covered by a
thin membrane; the interior of the protuberance forms a liollow‚ and I
suppose that the whole is an apparatus for hearing.

The mou-th is not protruding and very small in comparison with
the enormous body. The mandibles are very simple without palp, a
small protuberance represents the molar tubercle, and three or four short
bristles 01· teeth the biting process. The first pair of mamille& [Pl. Ι.
fig. 4] consist of three laminae, the median one is armed with 4-5
strong teeth. The second pair [Pl. I. fig. 3] consist of two laminae⁷ each
armed with two or three teeth. The mamillipecls [Pl. I. fig. 5] consist
of a broad hasal joint, two semicircular moveable laminae, truncated
at the anterior ends, without hairs or bristles⁷ and a large median
lobe. This lohe is deeply divided, so that it seems to consist of two
laminae.

The pew'ez'on [Pl. I. fig. l]. The first segment is a little shorter
than the second (11: 13), and does not reach so high. The second,
the longest of all, forms the summit of the globe‚ and is more than
'thrice as long at the dorsal side as at the ventral. It is twice as high
as the fifth segment, and nearly five times higher than the sixth. The
third segment is shorter than the second, (9: 13), but as long as the
fourth. The sixth segment is a little longer and a third higher than
the seventh‚ but both are comparatively compressed7 not inflated. The
epimerals are large, unequal3 that of the third segment is the largest,
that of the seventh the smallest‚ very minute. The more or less circu-
