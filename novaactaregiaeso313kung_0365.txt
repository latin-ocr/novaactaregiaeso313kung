The outer ramus 16 straight, even at the outer margin, finely serrated
at the inner margin.

The telson 16 short, broadly rounded, about a third of the length
of the peduucle of the third pair.

12. Mimonectes sphaericus, n. sp.

Diagn. Sphoera segmentis sex primis pereii formata.
Lougitudo capit& tertiam partem altitudinis aequans.
Antemzce superiores longitudenem eapitis aequantes.
Segmentum sextum peresi inflatum, segmentum septimum compressum.
Pedes peresi tertii paris quartam partem diametri sphaerae longitudine aequantes.
Pedes uri primi paris pedes secundi paris non superantes.

The ylobe 16 formed by the head and the six first pereional
segments.

The head 16 about three times higher than long.

The first pair of antennae are as long as the head.

The Sixtlz pereional seyment 16 inflated7 the seventh 16 of the ordi-
nary shape.

The third pair of pereiopoda equal about a fourth of the diameter
of the globe.

The first pair of mopoda do not reaeh to the end of the second.

Ι11 this species the globe is comparatively larger than in M. Lo-
vENl, and the legs are much shorter. The oircular space at the ventral
side of the body is framed by the head and all the pereional segments3
but the seventh segment (1666 not participate in the formation of the
globe3 it has still the more eompressed Hyperia-like shape. The pleon
and urus together do not equa] a. fourth of the diameter of the globe.

The head carries only six ocelli 611 each side; it 16 four times
higher than long.

The upper antemzce are like those of M. LovENJ, but 1666 serrated.

The lower antenna> are four—jointed.

The third segment of the pereion 16 the longest, the second and
third the highest, forming the summit of the globe. The second seg-
