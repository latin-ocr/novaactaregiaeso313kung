The body is compressed.

Th'e head is nari-ow, triangular

The eyes are very large, 0031080011 into one in the middle of the head, with
distinet large ocelli.

The first pair of autenm with 3 nmlti-artieulate flagellu1n; the first joint of
the flagellum very long, beset with long hairs.

The first four pairs of pereiopoda are unequal, setose3 the three last ones
subequal, elongate, with long dactyli.

The last pair of mopoda with the outer rami bi-artieulate.

The seleon is very large.

The genus Synopia was established in the year 1852 by Dana
upon specimens captured 111 1110 tropieal 8038 during the United states
Exploring Expedition 1838—1842. He distributed them into two
or rather three species, S. ultramarina, S. mzyustzfrons and S. 9¹1·aeilis‚ the
last one only conditionally, supposing that it might perhaps prove to
be the male of S. ultramarina. Judging from the descriptions and
drawings of Dana, compared with the alcohol-specimens of S. ultra-
marina at my disposal⁷ Ithink they are different species and shall
retain the 1131Πο proposed by Dana. SPENCE ΒΑΤΕ cites the two
species S. ultramarina and S. anyzcstz'frons, with short 011113018- fron]
Dana's descriptione and copies of some of his figures. In the year
1880 R. KOSSMANVN described some details of 3 Synopia from the
Red Sea3 he proposed for it the name S. orientalis. During the expe-
dition of His Swed. Majzs Corvette Balder,1881—82‚ Ι cap-
tured four specimens of a new species and one of S. ultramarina,
some twenty miles off the East coast of Barbadoes3 and in the (jarib--
bean Sea one specimen of another new species⁷ closely allied to S.
ultramarina and S. gracilis. Last year, in 3 very valuable collection of
Hyperids and other pelagio¹ Crustacea.⁷ made by Captain George von
Scheele during a voyage round the world¹) and presented to the Zoologi-

 

l) In the Swedish vessel Monarch, belonging to Consul Rettig of Gefle, who in
the kindest manner supported the zoological labour of Captain von Scheele.
