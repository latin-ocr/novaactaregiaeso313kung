Qualia aeid gives in neutral or slightly aeid solutions a volumi-
nous7 white, and caseons precipitate which soon becomes pulverulent
and crystalline. lt is solnble in boiling nitric aoid.

Allcalz'ne ooealcztes give white, non-crystalline precipitates of double
oxalatcs of samaria with oxalates of alkalis. These precipitates are
finely divided and not easy to wash.

Aeetas& of sodium gives on boiling with dilute solutions of samaria
no precipit-ate.

fflsposulplm'te of Sodium produces on boiling with salts vof sama-
rium no precipitate.

Ferrocyanicle of potasse gives with salts of samarium a yellowish
non-crystallino precipitate of ferrocyanide of samarium and potamium.-

Tartaric aeid gives with salvs of samarium a white⁷ voluminous
precipitate7 soluble in ammonia. The ammonica] solutions of the tartrate
depositv after some time at the ordimny temperatum7 and immediately on
hentfflg, a white powder. »-

Formiate of ammonia gives with concentrated solutions of salts
of samarium7 especialy on evaporating7 a white powder of little soluble
formiate of samarium. η

Boram (md m'z'crocosmz'c salt give with samaria colourless beads.

Peroxide of samarium.

If basio nitrate of samarium be heated to incipient redness ina
current of dry oxygcn as long as red vapours are given off, an oxide
remains which has a strong-er yellow tint than the oxide of samarium.
The loss on heating to a white lie-<it was found in two experiments to
amount to l.35 and 281 percent. When dissolved in a solution of a
known weight of ammonio-ferreus sulphate mixed with sulfuric aoid it
did not oxidise more of the ferrcus salt than corresponds to O.1 percent
of oxygen. lt, seems then highly improbable that-<1 peroxide of samarium
could be obtained in the manner described.

If peroxide of hydrogen (2 percent) be added to a solution of a
' samarium salt, no visible change occurs⁷ but on adding ammonia a gela-
tinous precipitate⁷ perfectly resembling the hydroxyde of samarium, is
produced. After a short while oxygen it given off in numerous small
bubbles. After washing, one portion of this precipitate, suspended.
in the liquid, was mixed with a known quantity of ammonio-fermus
sulphate. Ferric hydroxide was immediately thrown down. After adding
