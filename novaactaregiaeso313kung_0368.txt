epimerals. These do not oooupy the whole length of the under-margin
of the corresponding segments.

The first pair of pereiopoda [Pl. II. fig. 13] are shorter than the
second. The femur is broad‚la1ninar‚ and carries two long, strong, bristles
at the anterior lnargin; it is more than twice as long as broad. The
genu is longer than the tibia, which carries four or five bristles at ‘the
lower corner. The carpus is broad and long3 at the lower⁷ anterior
corner it carries a long spine-like bristle, nearly as long as the met-acar-
pus, and some shorter ones at the hinder margin. The metaearpus
is shorter than the carpus (ὗε 6), carrying long hairs and bristles at
its end7 which projeots anteriorly a little over the base of the dacty-
lus. The dactylus is straight, sliam, longer than half the metacar-
pus (7z 10).

The second pair. The fenmr is thrioe longer than broad, rectan-
gular, without hairs or bristles. The carpus is long and broad. The
metacczrpus is narrow, slender⁷ as long as the preceding joint3 it carries
a bundle of short hairs at the end. The dactylus is half as long as the
metaoarpus, feebly ourved. The branclrz'al sack· is nearly as long as the
leg⁷ the ουὶῃενοῑιδ lamella is quite as long as the leg and very broad,
irregularly fringed with long hairs.

The third pair are stouter and provided with broader joints than
in M. LovENi. The femur is more than twice as long as broad. The
carpus is only a little longer than the metacarpus.

The fourth, fifth, and siirtlz pairs are very similar to the third. The
fifth pair are the longest.

The seventlz pair are shorter than the sixth⁷ of the same length
as the first.

The pleon is like that of M. LovEM.

The peduncles of the pleosxocla are longer than the flagella. The
flagellum of the first pair eonsists of seven joint-s.

The uropoda. The first pair reach far beyond the end of the se-
cond pair; the peduncle is even, a little shorter than the inner ramus.
The out-er ‚ramus is straight, longer than half the interior; the inner
one is straight3 both are serrated at the margins. The peduncle of the
second pair does not reach to the end of the peduncle ofthe preceding
pair. The peduncle of the second pair is shorter than the outer ramus.
The inner ramus is a third longer than the outer; both rami are ser-
rated along the inner margins. The peduncle of the third pair is only
a little short-er ‘than the inner ramus and quite as long as the outer.
