30 CARL Bovnrms,

the maxillipeds are not eiliated, quite smooth; the 1111161· laminae are
more distinet than in the adult animal.

The pereion. The first seg1ne11t is short-er than the sixth and se-
venth together. The surfaee of the pereion shows the insertion of the
museles⁷ and is a. little granular.

The epimerals [Pl. III⁷ fig. 61] are smaller than in the adult anima-l.

The first pair of pereiopozla [Pl. HI, fig. 64] are pmpmtionassy
larger⁷ and the carpus not transformed as in the adult animal3 the meta-
carpns with the anterior angle directed forwards as usna]⁷ and thus the
dactylus artieulating in its ordinary plaee; the lower margin of the meta-
earpus shows only a few very minute tee1h3 the dactylus is shotter than
the lower margin os the metaearpus.

The second pair [Pl. III⁷ fig. 65]. The genn is shorter than half
the fe1nur; the metaearpus is nearly ovate7 and the dactylus pro-
portionally longer.

The third ancl fourth pairs [Pl. HI, fig. 66] have the tibia shorter
and not so much dilated as in the adult animal.

The fifth, simle, and seventh pairs have the femora very narrow
and the following joints smooth⁷ not serrated.

The 'pleon is longer than the first four pereional segments.

The pleopoda carry pointed flagella3 the peduneles are very long.

The urus [Pl. HI, fig. 67] is as long as the first two pereional
seglnents, and nearly as long as the first two pleonal ones. The ex-
cavation at the dorsal side of the first segment is very distinet; the first
segment is as long as the two following together. The third segment
is only a little longer than the second.

The first pair of uropocla with the rami narrower, without serra-
tiens3 at the lower end of the outer ramus there is a smallno‘teh7 indicat—
ing an earlier division 01 articul-atior} of the ramus. The same occurs
in the second pair.

The third pair do net reaeh beyond the tips of the second pair3
the rami are scarcely twice longer than the pedunele. The enter ramus
eonsists of two joints‚ as in Synopia⁷ the termina] joint equals a third of
the length of the basal joint. The inner ramus is nndivided⁷ smooth.

The telson is broad, not ronnded7 deeply exeavated, nearly bifid
at the middle of the posterior margin.
