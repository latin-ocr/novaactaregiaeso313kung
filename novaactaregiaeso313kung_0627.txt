AMPHIPODA SrNormEA. 13

The stleolmcla [Pl. I, fig. 19]. The peduneles are elliptieal, longer
than the flag-elim the number os articuli in the outer flagellum of the
first pair is 10, in the inner flagellum 9. The eilia} of the flagella
are pedunoulated, long, plumose3 the pedunoular part long, bnt shorter
than the rest [Pl. I, fig. 20].

The 'zor-us [Pl. Ι, fig. 21] The first segmentis only a little longer
than the second (ὃς 4); the last is nearly as long as the second. The
urus is as long as the first three pereional segments. The surface is
quite smooth.

The first pair of uropoda. The pedunele is linear, reaching to the
posterior margin of the last ural segment. The rami are uneqnal, the
inner much the longest, both ending with a strong movable claw-like
spine. The outer ramus is shorter than the pednnele, finely serrated
along the inner margin. The inner ramus is longer than the pedunele,
the inner margin smooth, carrying only one short spine at the middle and
two very small at the lower corner, at the base of the great olaw-like spine.

The second pair. The pedunole does not reaoh to the posterior
margin of ‘the last segment; the rami are unequal in length, the inner the
longest, both ending with short, feebly cui-ved spines, two in each. Both
rami are smooth on the outer margins and finely serrated along the inner.

The tlzz'rd pair. The pedunole is very short, broader below3 the
rami are unequal in length, tho onter the longest. The outer ramus is
two-jointed‚ the termina] joint equals a third of the length of the basal
joint. The outer margins of both rami are smooth, the lower parts of
the inner margins carry four simple hairs in the outer ramus, three
in the inner one3 at the lower end of the terminal joint of the outer ramus
there are two minute spines. The lower end of the inner ramus carries
also two minute spines and between them two long, strong hairs.

The telson is very large, triangular, obliquely trnncated behind,
divided beyond the middle by a longitudinal fissure. At the lower
ends there are some minute spines. The telson is longer than the
pedunele of the last pair of uropoda, almost as long as the last two
ural segments together.
