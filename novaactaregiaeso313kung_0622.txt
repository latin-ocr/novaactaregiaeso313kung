eye, detached from the head mass probably in an early period
of the development3 it is composed of three ocelli. The pigmentis
deep black.

The first pair of antemzoe [Pl. I, fig. 2] are a little different in
the male and the female3 the peduncle is three-jointed, the first joint
thick and long, the second scarcely as long as half the first, the
third as long as half the second. The secondary flagellum consists of
two joints, the first thick, five times longer than the second, beset with
five to six bristles. In the male it is longer than the first joint of the
true flagellum, in the female it equals the same joint in length. [Pl. I,
fig. 3]. The true flagellum consists of along, conical, a little tumidjoint,
like that of the genus Hyperia, carrying long hairs3 then follow in the
male nine, in the female four narrow joints, the terminal being the
longest, with a long hair at the apeX. In the male the first pair of
antennae reach to the anterior margin of the fifth segment, in the fe-
male scarcely to that of the fourth. ”

The second pair of autenm& [pl. I, fig. 2 a] are about twice longer
than the first. The first ¹joint of the peduncle is rounded, as long as
broad, the second very short, the third linear, as long as the two pre-
ceding together, the fourth is the longest, with minute hairs along the
anterior margin, the fifth as long as the third, with a long hair at the
lower anterior corner and minute ones along the anterior margin. The
flagellum consists in the male of 18, in the female of 12 articuli, in
the male every one carries two minute hairs at the upper anterior corner.
The flagellum is longer than the peduncle. The second pair of antennae
reach in the male to the first ural segment, in the female to half the
second pleonal segment.

The mouth-organs are well developed, constructed for mas—
tication.

The labrum [Pl. I, fig. 4] is divided 'into two semicircular pro—
jectione, which are fringed with strong hairs, seebly curved at the ends.

The mandibles [Pl. I, fig. 5] are very strong; a little beyond the
middle projects a thick, rounded. molar tubercle, whose grinding sui-face
is provided with 10 curved, strongly denticulated crests [Pl. I, fig. ss]; at
the outer side of the molar tubercle there is a bundle of denticu-
lated spines and bristles. Then follows a deep excavation with a row
os five long bifid spines [Pl. Ι, fig. 7]; the end of the mandible consists
of a hollowed process, denticulated at the apex. From the middle of
the outer margin of the mandible projects the three—jointed palp; the
