The lzead is much deepcr than the pereion, broad, smooth3 the
rostrum is very broad at the base, slightly tapering towards the 611(1,1116

pointing to the case of the Oxycephalidae.

The eyes occupy almost the whole sides of the head, separated
from one another only by a very narrow strip of the front, they cou-
sist each of large ocelli, ranged in 18 longitudinal rows, 9 in the upper-
most row and 3 in the undermost one, in all about 100 ocelli in each eye.

The first pair of ancennce [Pl. ΙΙΙ, fig. 42] are a third longer than
the head. The first joint os the peduncle is very thick and long, the
second very short, the third twice as long as the second. The flagellum
is lO- jointed3 the first J'oint is as thick at the base as the last peduncular
ι101111, and is almost as long as all 1116 following J'oints together (13: 15),
smooth, tapering antcriorly. The two following ι1011118 are short, equ 11
a little narrovver than the apex of the first joint3 the last seven joints
are shorter and narrower, tapering towards the end, without hairs or
bristles. The secondary flagellum is three-J'ointed, almost as long as the
first joint of the ordinary flagelluni; its first joint 18 very long and thick,

interpreted either as an auditory cavity, as the lower, circular sui-face
of the process seems to be closed by a 111111 membrane, or as a secret-
ory gland. The dissection of the organ gives more probability to 1116
latter supposition, because the process is filled with a granular mass
and only a few very minute hairs are to be seen at the bettoni of
the joint. The second and third joints are very short, but hroad3
