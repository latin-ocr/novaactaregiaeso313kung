ment is scarcely more than a fourth higher than the fifth (41: 29), but
eight times higher than the seventh. All pereiopoda, with the exception
of the first and last pairs7 carry brancln'al sat-les. The epimerals are distinet.

The first pair of pereiopocla are a little shorter than the second
pair. The femur is long7 laminar. The carpus is broad, longer than the
vnetczeaiyms, which is tapering towards the end, with a tuberonlous exten-
sion at the hinder margin, against which extensior] the feebly eurved
dactylus impinges. The dactylus equals a third of the length of the me—
tacarpus.

The second pair. The s'ernccr is a little broader than in the first
pair. The carpus· is shorter than the metaearpus. On this joint the
extension at the hindei· margin is more developed than in the first pair5
armed With short strong spines, thus forming a good forfex. The (lac-
tylus is longer than a third of the metaearpus.

Of the ether pereiopoda the fifth pair are the longest. The se—
venth pair are longer than the first. The branehial saeks of the second
pair are longer than half the legs <5: 7). These of the third⁷ fourth,
fifth, and sixth pairs are nearly as long as the legs.

The pleon is like that of the preceding speeies.

The outer ramus of the first pair of uropoda is longer than half
the inner⁷ both are straight. The pedunele of the second pair reaches
beyond that of the first pair.

The tel-§¹072 is longer than half the pednnele of the third pair ofnropoda.
