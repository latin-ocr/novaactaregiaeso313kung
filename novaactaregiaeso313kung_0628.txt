2. Synopia caraibiea. N. sp.

Diagn. (must triangulare, longitudine latitudinem superans.

Oculi parvi supplementarii, singuli, supra bases untmlnurum primi paris siti.

*lammae primi puris quam pereion multo breviores, fiagello valde setoso.

Flagellum' secundarium longitudine articulum primuni flagelli (veri) superans.

Segmontum primum pescli seeundum longitudino aequans, sextum et septi—
mum aequalia.

Femoru parium quinti, sexti et septimi pedum peresa? elongato—ovata. Pedes
quinti paris longissimi, sequentes longitudine decrescentes.

Pedunenli pedum. ples ovati.

Segmentum primuni acre? seeundo duplo longine.

Telsou ovutmn, leviter fissum,

The head is triangular, longer than broad.

A small secondary eye on each side of the head⁷ at the base of
the first pair of antennae. i

The first pair of autenm& are much shorter than 1116 pereion, the
flagellum is riehly provided with huirs along its whole length. The se-
eondary flagellum is longer than the first- joint of the true flagellum.

The first segment of the perez'on equale the second in length3 the
sixth is as long as the seventh.

The femora of the fifth, sixth, ¹<md seventh pairs ‹:›fperei0p0da are
elongate-ovate⁷ almost pear-shaped. The fifth pair are the longest, the
following deereasing.

The peduncles of the pleopoda are egg-shaped.

The first segment of the mus is twice as long as the second.

The telson is ovate, only a little bifid.

The only specimen of this animal that I got was very damaged,
being taken from the stomaoh of an Exoeoetus. It seems to be closely
allied to S. ultramarina, hut is distinguished from it by comparatively
good eharaeteristies⁷ as the setose flagellum of the first pair of antennae,
the form ef the femora of the last three pairs of pereiopoda, especially
of the last, and the form of the telson.

The body is arehed⁷ but not as much as in S. ultramarina.
The head is proportionally much lai-ger than in the preceding
species⁷ more obtuse3 the exeavation for the insertion of the first pair
