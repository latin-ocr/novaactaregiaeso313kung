Dana proposed the above quoted name for the animal, but he thought
that it might possibly prove to be the male of S. ultranrarina. As I
have got males among the speeimens, which I have identified with Da-
na's S. ultramarina, I must retain the name of Dana, allowing that the
animals are closely allied.

»The body is more slender than in S. ultramarina, and has no
convexity along the back.»

»The excavation in the lower part of the head⁷ from which the
antennae proeeed is very large‚ being as broad as the part af the head
immediately above.»

»The superior antennae are sparingly shorter than the body3 fla-
gellum of the inferior pair scabrone.»

Colour. »More or less entirely ultramarino.» »The blue eolour
was deepest along the venter. The four anterior legs
and the bases of the superior antennae had the same
rich blue eolour.»
