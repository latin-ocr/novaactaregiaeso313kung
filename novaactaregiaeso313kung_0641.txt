corner trunoated, as long as the lirst two peroional segnivuts. The
epimeral of tho third segnient is 118 long as the sognlont7 but twice as
deep, rounded at 1110 anterior margin⁷ straight at tho hiuder. That
of the fourth seglnent is fully as long as the segnient, the anterior
margin rmmdod, the inferior straight7 the lower hinder corner truncate,
and tho hinder margin cleoply excavatod. The epilneral of the fifth
segnient is longer than the segnient and longer than deep, with ob-
tusely rounded eorners. The epiinerals of the sixth and seventh sog—
nients are snialler, not so deep as the preceding, scarcely longer than
the corresponding seglnonts⁷ with feobly rounded corners.

The brancltial Meles are very large, thiu, showing very broad white
crests or bands orossing each other at acute angles. They are fixvd
at the bases of the second to seventh pairs of pereiopoda.

The ovitectrz'ces [Pl. HI, fig. 49] are shorter than 1110 branchial
sacks‚ lance-elate, four ou each side.

The first pair of pereiopocla [Pl. HI, fig. 50] are onormously devo-
1011011, and characterize the animal at once. The femur is long and
narrow, slightly beut at both ends3 the granu is tolerably long and
stout; the tibia is shorter; the carpus a little longer, but transfornied,
aud turned round baokwards, pressed against the nietz‘learpus with the
whole length of the joint, thus turning round the inetaoarpus so that the
original anterior corner seems to be the posterior. The metacawyms is
globularly inflated, bordered by sharp, recurved teeth along the under
margin, against which the dactylus inipinges3 the anterior corner 181110-
vided with five tooth-shaped tubereles and two movable, strong bristles·
The dactylas articulates against the apparently lzz'mleo· 0011101· of the nien
tacarpus, it is quite as long as the underside of the inetacarpus, feebly
curves]7 without teeth or serrations. The hand thus forms a most po-
werful instrument for holding fast 1110 animal to the body os its host,
the animal probably living as ecto-parasite ou sharks, and other larger
fishes⁷ prinoipally from greater clepths.

The second pair [Pl. HL fig. 51] The femur is long7 smooth,
broader at the lower end3 the ιᾳεηῖι 18 of an unusual length, a little
shorter than the femur and longer than 1110 carpus3 the tibia equals
half the length of the femur3 the carpus is longer⁷ richly beset with
hairs; the vnetacarpus is short, broadly triangular, surrounded with hairs.
The very small claetylusis articul-cited at the middle of the lower margin of 1110
underside of 1110 metaearpus, not as usual at the anterior corner. The
part of the margin, against which the dactylus inipinges, is denticulated,
