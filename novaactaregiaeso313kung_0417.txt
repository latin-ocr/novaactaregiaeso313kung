Borate of didymium
Di BQ.

On adding oxide of didymium to fused borax 311 amethyst-colou-
red glass is obtained, which heated for some time over 3 BUNSEN burner
becomes 311 enamel. Unter the microseope it appeared as a transparent
glass full of minute prisms. The mass was powdered and earefully
treated with oold water containing hydroohlorio aoid. The borax was
thus dissolved and 3 mixture of boraeic aeid and borate of didymium
was left. The boraoic aeid was dissolved out with boiling water after
which the borate was washed with 31001101 and dried. The salt was te-
sted for sodium, but was free from it. It is easily soluble in hydro-

chlorio aeid.

O.6648 gram was dissolved in HOl and gave with oxalie aeid
O.5490 gram Di2O3.

O.5410 gram gave O.4465 gram Di2O3.

Anhydrometaphosphate of didymium
Di203,5P2O5.

Anhydrous sulphate of didymium was added to melting metaphos-
phorio aoid and heated to redness. The resultant mass, treated with
water, left 3 heavy violet powder, consisting of well formed 1111010500ρί-
031, 'fabular erystals of the same form as the corresponding salt of sa-
marium. The salt is insoluble in acids.
