SAMARIUM. 25

Car-bonate of samarium and ammonium
ΒηῃΝΗΗ 2 CO3 -1- 2H2O.

The voluminous and amorphous preoipitate which earbonate of
ammonium gives with the niti-ate of samarium changes after some time
into a heavy powder consisting of small rounded granules⁷ provided it
be left at- the ordinary temperature in presence of an excess of carbo-
nate of ammonium. Only a traoe of samarium remains in the solution.
Heated to 100Ο the salt loses water and ammonia. The compound
was pressed between filter-paper and analysed.

08269 gram was dissolved in hydrochlorie aoid and precipitated
with tetraohloride of platinum, When O.6224 gram (NH >2P⁴cClG was obtai-
ned. From the filtrate the platinum was precipitated with H2S, and
04368 gram Sm203 obtained as oxalate.

ear-bonate of samarium and sodium
Sm,Na‚ 2003 -i- 8H20.

The nitrate of samarium gives with an exoess of earbonate of
sodium a voluminous and amorphous preeipitate, which soon changes
¹into a yellowish white powder consisting of mieroseopio orystalline ag-
gregates. Only-small traces of samarium remain in the solution. The
salt was pressed between filter-paper and analysed. Heated in air—bath
to 100ο the compound loses 6 mol. H2O (found 2454 and 24.69; calcu-
lated 24.71 peremi).

0-4360 gram gave O.1751 gram Sin-,03 and 0.0651 gram Na Ol.
