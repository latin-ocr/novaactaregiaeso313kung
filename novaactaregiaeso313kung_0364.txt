of the eegment. The femur ie more than thrice ae long as broad (10: 3),
linear⁷ elnooth. The ¹qemi and tibia ae in the preceding pair. The carpus
ie long and broad, ewollen or inflated⁷ containing a row of glande3 possibly
the secretione of the glande pase into the metacarpue and through a large
opening behind the dactylus out into the water [Pl. II. fig. 20]. The
metacarpus ie only half as long ae the carpus, broad and wide; the aper-
ture in its lower end, behind the dactylus7 ie bordered with long heire⁷
which are bent ae hooke at the tipe. The dactylus is shorter than a
fourth of the metacarpns, broad, and feehly curved. Only in one speci-
men there was a brancltial sack-‚- thie was ehorter than the femur.

The pleon is built in the ordinary way, not inflated, rather more
elender than in the true Hyperiae. The first seginent is the longeet
and deepest‚ but not twice higher than the third (32 2). The third ie
the ehortest. The hindei* cornere of the segments are rounded. The
pleon and urus together are longer than a third of the diameter of
the globe.

The pleopoda. The pedunclee are longer than the flagella. The
third pair are much shorter than the preceding. The flagellum of the
first pair consiste of 9-—12 articuli, which carry long plnmoee hairs or
ciliae. [Pl. HI. fig. 26].

The urus [Pl. ΙΙΙ. fig. 27] consiste of two join‘re7 the. second and
third being eoalesced, as usual among the Hyperide. The firet joint
ie a little shorter than the second, bnt broader. The second, cr coalesced
one, is a little narrower behind.

The first pair of uropoda are long⁷ slender⁷ but do not rcach quite
to the end of the second pair. The peduncle is ehorter than the inner
ramus, linear, smooth⁷ with a brietle at the lower inne-r corner. The in-
ner ramus ie twice longer than the outer, and much broader fit the base,
sharply pointed dowmmrds, and fecbly bent; it is serrated along both
margins. The out-er one ie >very narroxv, very feebly bent at the tip3 the
outer margin even, the inner finely serrated.

The second pair. The peduncle reaches beyond the end of the
peduncle of the first pair3 it ie ehorter than the inner ramus, linear,
emooth. The inner ramus is a third longer than the outer, and a little
broader at the base, etraigl]t; the onter margin is even, the inner pro-
vided with minute haire only at the tip. The outer ramus is straight, the
outer margin even, the inner armed in the same way ae the inner ramus.

The third pair are very stout. The peduncles very broad, shorter
than the inner ramus, smooth. The inner ramus, broad at the base,
