Mmomzersss, A REMARKABLE GENUs or AMPfflPonA HYPERIDEA. 13

The first pair of antenme 316 longer than the head, not serrated.

All the pereional se‘qments 316 1111131611.

Τ116 third pair of pereiopodcz are only 3 111116 longer than one
eighth of the diameter of the globe.

The first pair of uropocla 163611 far beyond the end of the 66-
cond pair.

Here the globe is most developed, much larger than in both the
preceding species. Also the proportion between the body and the legs is
anot-her. The 611611131· space 31 1116 ventral side of the body is limited
· by the head, all the pereional segments‚ and the first of the pleonal seg-
11161116, which however does not participate in forming the globe. The
pleon and urus together equal 3 fifth of 1116 diameter of the globe.

The head is three times 36 high 36 long, but 36 broad 36 high.
It is broader below 111311 upwards.

The eyes 316 six to eight on each side.

The topper antennae 316 broad and stout, thick 311116 11366, tapering
towards the end, consisting of 3 two-jointed peduncle3 the hasal joint is
very thick and broad, the second joint larger 111311 in M. Lovsfflw. The first
joint of the flagellum 16 broad 31 the 11366, tapering towards the end3 it
carries, on the inner side⁷ 31 the under-margin, two rows of long olfac-
tory (P) hairs3 each 11311 16 fixed on 3 little butten or round disk. The
upper margin of the joint is quite even. After the long 113631 joint of
the flagellum follow three short slender joints⁷ the second the longest3
all without teeth. The 1361 one carries two long linire, the preceding
one hair each. Beneath the base of the 11111161Ί 3111601136 there is on
each side a rounded protuberance, 31, 1116 summit of which there is 3 11016
protected by a 111111 11161111113116.

Behind these protuberances the lower anteum& are fixed. They 316
four-jointed‚ like those of M. Lov1'3N1. They equal a third of 1116 length
of the upper antennae.

lee pereion. The first segment is half 36 long and half 36 high
as the second, which is the longest of 311, and six times longer 31 the
dorsal curvature 111311 at the ventral side. The summit of the globe is
formed of the third segment⁷ which 16 3 little inore 111311 half 36 long
as the second. *The third segment is 3 fourth higher than the fifth,
more than twice higher 111311 1116 6111111, and more than five times higher
than the seventh. The second 10 sixth segments carry branchial sacks
and ovitectrices. The first to sixth segments show small 11111 distinct
