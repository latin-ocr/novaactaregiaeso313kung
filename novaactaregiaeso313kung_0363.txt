MiMONEC'rEs, A REMARKABLE 0111108 OF Amprupom HYPERIDEA. ⁴2)

The fozcrtlz pair are very similar to the third, but shorter (132
15). The epimeral is deep, rounded, smaller than the preceding, and
does not ocoupy the whole under-side of the segment. The femur is
as long 38 the three following joints together, four times as long 38
broad. The 111-(171611ἰαί sack is about half as long as the leg7 the 00196-
rous lamella only a little shorter than the leg.

The fifth. pair [Pl. III. fig. 24] are longer than the fourth pair, but
shorter than the third (14: 15). The epimeral is long and large⁷ with
rounded corners and an excavation at the middle of the under-side; it
occupies nearly the whole length of the segment. The femur is nearly
four times as long as broad (501 13), linear, with some short hairs at
the anterior margin. There is a round gland in the lower part of the
joint. The glemu is short, the anterior margin fringed with minute 113118.
The tibia is broad and long7 twice as long as the preceding joint3 the
anterior margin is finely serrated and fringed with minute hairs. The
carpus is longer than the tibia, serrated at both margins, carrying at the
anterior margin the same kind of hairs as the preceding joint. The in-
terior of the joint is occupied by a row of larger and 8111311οΓ rounded
glande. The metaearpus is shorter than the carpus (32 5), fringed with
very minute hairs at the anterior margin. The dactylus is short and
feebly curved. The branclzz'al sack equals half the length of the leg,
the ovz'qerous lam-ella scarcely more than a third.

The sixtlz pair [Pl. H. fig. 18] are more slender than the preceding and
of the same length 38 the fourth pair. The epimeral is 8111311, not half as long
38 the preceding, rounded3 it does not occupy more than *a third of the
length of the segment. The femur 18 111010 than twice as long as broad
(81 3)y without 113118 01 bristles. Some very small, globular glande are
to be seen in the lower part of the joint. The yeme equ-als one fourth
of the length of the femur, and 18 smooth. The tibia 18 111010 than
twice as long as the preceding joint, linear, smooth. The carpus 18
longer⁷ linear, smooffl, with 3 small glandular mass in the middle. The
metacarpus 18 shorter than the carpus⁷ linear, with some fine hairs at
the lower end. The dactylus 18 nearly straight, only 3 sixth of the
length of the metacarpus. lee branclzial sack· is shorter than half the
leg (5: 13). The oviyerous lamella is a little shorter than the bran-
chial sack.

The seventlz pair of pereiopoda [Pl. ΙΙ. fig, 19] are 38 long 38
the first pair. The epimeral is very minute, half 38 long 38 the preced-

ing, rounded⁷ not occupying more than 3 fourth of the under-margin
