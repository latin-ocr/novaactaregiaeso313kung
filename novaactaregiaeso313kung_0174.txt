Vanadates of samarium.

The neutral solutions of the salts of samarium and alkaline meta-
vanadates give a light yellow perfeotly amorphous preoipitate⁷ consisting
for the greater part of hydrated orthovanadate of samarium. The num-
bers found on analysis did not agree sufficiently well with those calcu-
lated to make me think it. worth publishing them. If a solution of bi-
vanadate of sodium be mixed with a solution of the nitrate of samarium,
a yellowish amorphous preeipitate is thrown down, probably the ortho-
vanadate of samarium, and from the filtered solution on spontaneous
evaporation at the ordinary temperature two different sets of erystals ⁷
are obtained. The one set has the colour of biehronate of potash and
the other a more yellow colour. Both form large⁷ extremely beautiful

crystals.
A. lee red salt Sm2O3‚ 5V2O5 -Ι- 28H2O.

0.3760 gram lost on heating to 100⁰ 0.0864 gram H2O and at
incipient redness 00196 gram more. The anhydrous salt was dissolved
in HC] and reduced with 802. On adding oxalie aeid and igniting the
oxalate 0.0726 gram S1n2O3 was obtained. The filtrate from the oxalate
of samarium was evaporated to dryness and the residue carefully heated
so as to volatilize the exeess of oxalio aoid. It was then oxidised with
very dilute nitrio aeid⁷ evaporated to dryness and heated so as to melt
the vanadic aeid, the weight of which was found to be O.1953 gram,
but which however contained 0.0027 grain Sm2O3. The analysis had thus
given O.1926 gram V2O5 and 0.0753 gram Sm2O3.
