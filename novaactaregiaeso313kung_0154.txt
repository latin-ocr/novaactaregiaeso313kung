Bromide of samarium

SmBr3 4- 6H2O.

On evaporating, over sulphurie aeid, a solution of oxide of sa-
marium in hydrobromio aoid, to the eonsistenoy of a syrup⁷ large⁷ well
developed, topas—yellow crystals are deposited, which resemble in form
orystals of gypsum. There crystals are very deliquescent and when
heated give off water and hydrobromie aeid, even though mixed with
excess of ammonium bromide. The whitish residue leaves on treatment
with water, brilliant mioaoeous orystals, probably of an oxybromide,
which are slowly attacked by aeids.

O.7634 gram of the crystallised bromide, pressed between paper‚
gave 08540 gram Agssr and O.266-2 gram Sm203.

Chloropla'tinate of samarium

emon, [aot ΔΓ 10¹l2H2O-

By slowly evaporating mixed solutions of the simple clamides, large
prismatio orystals of deep orange colour are obtained. The chloro-
platinate is easily soluble and deliqveseent. It looses at 110⁰ about

4 mol. H2O.
