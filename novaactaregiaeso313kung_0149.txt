SAMARlUM.

Oxide of samarium
Sm203.

It forms an almost white poWder having a very slight yellowish
tint. It is easily soluble in aeids and is not reduced by ignition in a
current of hydrogen. It forins no higher oxide on ignitior] in oxygen.
The oxide is very hygroseopic.

Hydroxide of samarium.

It is a gelatinous, white, and bulky precipitate which absorbe
carbonio aoid from the fiir, but to a. less degree than the hydroxides of
the other cerium-metals. l‘c dries to yellowish semi-transparent fragments.
It is not soluble in alkalis7 but is easily soluble in acids and expels
ammonia from ammoniaoal salts, if boiled with their solutions.

Salts of samarium.

The salts of samarium are of a. yellovv eolour, ‘shough sometimes
almost white, their concentrated solutions are ⁴also yellovv ¹<ind give a
peouliar absorption-speotrum. The ‘caste of the soluble salts is sweetish
and very astringent.

Sulphuretted lzydroqen gives no precipitare with the salts of saniarium.

Sulplzlzydrate of ammonia precipitates hydroxide of saniarium.

Alkalz‘s precipitate completely hydroxyde of samarium, insoluble in
exeess of alkalis.

All-aliae carbonates give gelatinous and voluminous precipitales,
soluble⁷ if reoently preoipitated, in exeess of the reagents. After some
time very slightly soluble double oarbonates separate out.

Sulphate of potaslz gives With not too dilute solutions of salts of
samarium a white preoipitate, very slightly soluble in a satin-abed solution
of sulphate of potash; 100 parts of the saturated solution cont-ain about
0.05 part Sffl-203· The solubility is very much influenoed by the pre-
sence of the other earths. The solubility is inereased by the presence of
the yttria—earths.
