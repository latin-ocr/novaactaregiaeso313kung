pluinos‹› hair at the lower hindei· corner. The fifth joint carries some
minute hairs along the anterior margin, and at the lower end. The
flagellum is a third longer than the peduncle, the first joint is the
10113001, about half as long as the last joint of the peduncle, the 10110-
wing are short, tapering towards the end.

The mo‘zctlz-orfyans are transformed into a projecting tube, 1011111113
a. powerful boring and suclzing instrument.

The labrum [Pl. ΙΙΙ, fig. 44] forms a long, triangular, open
0111111001, bifid at the lower end, with sharp, 100111-011111)οᾶ ponite, exea-
vated at the base to afford place 101 1110 niandibular palps.

The mamlz'bles [Pl. ΙΙΙ, fig. 45] consist of a broad, strong basal
portion, projecting into a long, single, sharp-pointed, styliform process3
at 1110 base 01 1110 process it carries a large, stout palp3 the first joint
011110 palp is very short but l;›road; the second very 10113, elongate-
ovate, with an oblique row of long, simple hairs fron] the middle 10
1110 uppcr end3 the third joint 10 11 111110 01101101 than the second, bor-
dered by long hairs along the inner margin.

The first pair of maxillae [Pl. ΙΙΙ, fig. 46] have the outer lamina
reduced, the inner elongate, with four strong teeth 111 1110 apex.

The second pair of mamillae [Pl. ΙΙΙ, fig. 47] with both 1111111010
elongate, narrOW, carrying minute 100111 at the ends.

The mamillz'jmds [Pl. ΙΙΙ, 113. 48] are coalesced into a gouge-like
0111111001, forming together with the labrum the walls 011110 tube; the
two first joints 01 the right inaxilliped are 00111000οἀ with the corre-
sponding joints 01 1110 left one, the inner 1111011110 are very narrow,
concealed by 1110 enter, which are large, hollowed, placed close to one
another. The palp is four—jointed, as usual, the first ¹joint short, the
second, twice longer, equalling the third, the fourth is the 10113001.
The second and third carry long hairs at the exterior ends.

The pereion. The first segment is 1003, 1110 10113001 of all, equal—
ling the last two ones together in length, the second to fifth segments
arc equal, the hinder 0010010 feebly rounded. At the dorsal side of the
sixth and seventh segments there is a slight ovate excavation. The
surface is hard and smooth, white as ivory. The scgments are a little
convex longitudinally, distinctly separated 11001 0110 1111011101·; the first
is soniewhat higher than the others.

The epimemls [Pl. ΙΙΙ, 113. 41] are well developed, that 01 1110
first segnient is long bnt not very deep, triangular, partly concealed
by 1110 following, which is enorinous in sizo, triangular, with the upper
