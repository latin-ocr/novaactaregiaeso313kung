The molybdate of samarium, Sm23MoO4‚ formed small rhombic
octahedrons and combinations of the horizontal and vertical prisms.
Some crystals attained a length of ¹l4-—¹s10 of a millimetre. They had a
diamond-lustre and a dark violet colour⁷ occasioned by a ‘trace of mo-
lybdic oxide. Heated in the air they became white. They were very
slowly decomposed by hydrochloric aoid. The spec. gra-V. was 5.95,
but this number is only approximate as the salt wass not pure. The
analysis gave 474 percent Sm2O³ instead of 4462 percent.

Molybdate of samarium and sodium
SmNa2MoO4.

As described above, thin microscopic needles of this salt were
obtained along with the neutral molybdate of samarium, by fusing mo-
lybdic aoid and oxide of samarium with chloride of sodium. Separated
from the neutra} salt by elutriation‚ it formed a voluminous wolly mass
of a dirty violet colour, which oolour disappeared on gently heatiug in
the air. Warm dilute hydrochloric aoid dissolves this salt easily.

O.4402 gram gave O.1518 Sm203 and 0.0597 gram NaCl.

Spec. GraV. = 5265 at 180 as mean of two determinatione. As
the salt was not perfectly pure⁷ this number may be regarded as only
an approximation.

Tunqstate of samarium and sodium
Sm4 Na6 9 W04.

Was obtained by Mr HOGBOM¹), who heated tungstic aoid with a
corresponding quantity of the oxide of samarium in an excess of chlo-
ride of sodium. The salt forms brown microscopical crystals. The

analysis gave:
