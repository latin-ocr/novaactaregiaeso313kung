AMPHIPODA SYNOPIDEA. 9

first joint is very short-3 the second very 10118, tnmid, irregularly ovate,
carrying a single plumose hair near the enter end3 the last joint is mi-
nute, scarcely a tenth of the length of the preceding, with two very
long, plnmose hairs at the 1111. Α1 1119 base of the mandibular palp there
are two strong, denticulated, 111981109101)7 projections.

The first pair of mamillae [Pl. I, fig. 8] consist of a short basal
joint and two robust laminae3 the outer one is the longest and broadest,
carrying a row of nine to ten strong spines at the end, and another
row of six spines a little behind, near the middle of the lamina. The
inner lamina is fringed with long hairs along the inner margin, and
carries a row of 7—8 uneqnal spines at the end.

The second pair of mamillae [Pl. I, fig. 9] 00118181Ι of tWo laminae,
the inner is the larger, ovate, With a row of five peculiar, denticulated
spines at 1119 end [Pl. I, fig. 10], and a longitudinal roW of 14-715
long, simple spines on the inner side of the lamina. The inner lamina
is oblcng, with about a dozen long bristles at. the top.

The 'narvillz'peds [Pl. Ι, fig. 11] 919 very large, when closed, totally
covering the other oral organs. The basal joints are coalesced, the
following free, both laminae are ovate, fringed with long, plumose
119118, 1119 first along the inner, the second along the outer margin. The
palp is four-jointed, the first joint is short and thick, the second three
times longer than the first, fringed along the outer margin with long,
plumose hairs. The third joint is narrower, half as long as the second,
with long, simple hairs at the end; the fourth joint is very minute,
about a fifth of the length of the preceding.

The pereion. The first segment 18 9 little longer than the second,
but shorter than the third, the third to fifth are eqnal, the sixth is much
longer, longest of all, the seventh segment is longer than the fifth.
The surface of the segments is very smooth, the posterior 00111918
919 feebly rounded.

The epimerals (Pl. I, fig. 1) are well developed‚ but very 111111 and
totally pellucid3 they are very easily overlooked, which may be the
reason why they are not described by Dana, but only mentioned in the
explanation of the plates and figured from the third segment together
With the correspondent leg. (Dana 1. c. p. 996, pl. 68, fig. 6, e).
The epimerals cf the first and second segments are as long as the
segments, of in irregular shape and only half as deep as long. The
epimerals of t e third segment [Pl. Ι, fig. 13] are enormously de-
veloped; they ar& quadrangular with the upper corner (the art-iculation with
