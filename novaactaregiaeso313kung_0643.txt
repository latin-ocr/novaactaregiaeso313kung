The first pair of uropoda reach to the ends of the peduncles of

The second pair reach as far as the third pair3 the rami are nar-

The third pair are nearly as long as the two last ural segmentis,
the rami are more than twice longer than the peduncle, lanceolate,
smooth.

The telson is almost circular7 longer than the peduncle of the last
pair, with the margins smooth.

The specimens examined were probably just out from the incuba—
tory pouch of the mothcr; they present some interesting differences,
which will be shortly mentioned below. Some of these characteristics
point decidedly to the family Synopidae.

The head 16 longer than the first pereional segment.

The eyes are distinctly faceted‚ bnt without the brown pigment.

The first pair of antennae [Pl. III, fig. 62] are nearly twice as long
as the head, the flagellum four-jointed‚ the secondary flagellum two-jrmited.

The second pair of antennae [Pl. III⁷ fig. 63] have only fonrjoints
in the flagellum, the first joint very long.

The mouth-omaus are very similar to those of the adult animal,
but the palp of the mandibles wants hairs⁷ and the teeth at the ends
of the maxillae are but feebly developed⁷ the laminae and the palp of
