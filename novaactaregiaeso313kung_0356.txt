CARI. BovALLius,

MIMONEGTIDAE.

Hyperids with the head and a part or the whole of the pereion
developed into an enormous balloon-shaped globe. Oeelli not united but
dispersed on each side of the head. The upper antennae long, mereor
less straight. The lower 0111011, four-jointed. The mandibles without
palp. The maxillipeds well developed.

Mimoneetes, n. g.
Derivafio, Mmog: mimic, imitator, aud νήκτης.· swimmer.

Diagn. Caput magnum, latum, valde inflatum, simul eum pereio sphaeram formans.
Oculi parvi, dispersi.
Antfflmoe superior& longae, rectae, flagello articulato.
Antennae 'inferiores parvae.
Pleon compressum non inflatum.
Pedes (1)-ῑῖ duos ramos gerentes.

The head and the pereion are inflated, forming together an enor-
mous globe.

The eyes are small⁷ seattered over 1110 sides of the head.

The upper antenna> are long, straight, with artioulated flagellum.

The lower antenme are small.

The pleon is eompressed‚ not inflated.

The uropoda are provided with two 101111.

The genus Mimoneetes is easily distinguished from other Hype-
rids by its globular shape, with all the legs, branchial 000110, ovigerous
lamellae and the urus hanging down, similar to 1110 filaments of 0 1110-
(11100. But it differs also by some anatomical and morphological charae-
teristies from all or most of the other Hyperids. As important points
I mention the structure of the eyes and of the nervous system, and that
the interior of the pereion forms a bladder containing a fluid.

With the genus Lamzeola, SAY ¹) it agrees in the strong deve-
lopment of the maxillipeds, with Cysteosoma‚ GUF'JRIN and ΤΥΒΟ, MILNE-
EDWARDs2) in the form of the upper antennae‚ with the true Hyperiae
in the shape of the urus and its appendages.
