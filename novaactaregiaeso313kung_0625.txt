AMPsslPoDA SYNOPIDEA. 11

there are 3—4 long, simple hair-s, longer than tho dactylus The ‹lactylus
is strong, feebly curvod, only a little shorter than the mctacarpus.

The second pair. The femur is long, nari-ow, smooth, the yeme is
very short, the tibia inore than twice longer, smooth. The carpus is
longer than the femur, more than five times longer than broad, the an-
terior margin straight, the posterior feebly curved and provided with very
strong, plumose bristlcs3 at the npper third of the joint these bristles are
geniculate, six in nnmber3 at the lower part they are straight, very
long, 8—10 in number. The metacarpus is longer than half the carpus,
a little dilated, four times longer than broad. The anterior margin is
nearly straight, the posterior irregularly cin-ved, fringed with 10—12
strong, plnmose bristles, longer than the breadth of the joint. At the
lower end there are two long, simple hairs on each side of the dactylus,
as long as the metacarpus itself. The dactylus is very small, shorter
than a sixth of the length of the preceding joint, pedunculated3 the
peduncular part is a little longer than the claw.

The third pair [Pl. l, fig.13]. The femur is as long as the epi—
mera] is deep, broader at the posterior margin; the ymno is short, the
tibia very long and broad, laminar, with the hindei· margin strongly
caused, the anterior straight, smooth, with a single simple hair at each
of the lower corners. The carpus is broad, ovate, laminar, the hinder
margin fringed with 10-11 nnequal, plnrnose hairs; it is longer than
the tibia (162 13). The tibia and carpus together eqnal the length
of the femur. The metaearpus is narrow, nearly linear, shorter than
the carpus (13ε 17), the posterior margin with three simple hairs.
The dactylus is a little longer than half the metacarpus, peduncnlated3
the peduncular part is elongate, lanceolate, more than twice as long as
the claW, which is feebly curved' sharp. ,

The fourth pair [Pl. I, fig. 14] Thefemur is elongate-elliptical, very
narrow at the Upper end, with a long, simple hair at the lower posterior
corner. The yeme is short, with a plninose hair at the posterior margin.
The tibia very broad, laminar⁷ triangular with rounded cornei-s⁷ broader
than long (14:53), with a plnmose hair at the hinder margin and a long
simple one at the anterior corner. The carpus is long and very broad,
laminar, the anterior margin is straight, the under margin nearly straight, 1116
hinder margin curved‚ and the upper margin excavated. It is scarcely a
third longer than broad. Along the lower and hindei· margins there is a row
of 15 plnmose hail-s, the longest shorter than the breadth os the joint.
The metacarpus is elongate—ovate, longer than half the carpus, with four
