Mimicry or the faculty of mimicking, or disguising themselves, ac-
quired by certain animals, which are exposed to the⁴ attacks of many
enemies, or by their slowneSS, etc, are but little adapted to catch their
prey, has long been a well-known fact, and it has been studied in dif-
ferent groups. But, as far as I know, it has never yet been observed
among the Amphipoda. The remarkable Hyperids, treated in this pa-
per, presenting, according to my opinion, an instance of mimicry, this
circumstance seems to me another reason to publish a description
of them.

Among the collections of pelagio Crustacea, brought together du-
ring the expedition of H Swed. M. Frigate Eugenie‚ and kindly entrusted
to me by Professor SVEN LOV1'3N for determination, a little amphipod
attracted my attention by the enormous globular development of its
body. Put into a larger glass with spiritus, it offered at the first sight
a strilffl'szy resemblance to a little jellgsfislz by the hyaline, bell-shaped
form of the fore-part of the body, and by the straight slender legs and
the minute tail, hanging down as filaments. Afterwards Igot larger
specimens of the same species and some other allied ones in a very
valuable collection of Hypexids, sent to me by Professor JAPETUS STREN-
STRUP from the University Museum at Oopenhagen through the kind in—
termediation of Professor LovEN. Thus provided with a comparatively
rich material I submitted it to a closer examination, the results of which
are given below. l

The examination of the mouth-organs and other parts of (the ani-
mal showed that it must doubtless be ranged among the Amphipoda
Hyperidea, and also that it must be set down as a genus of its own.
I propose for it the- name of Mimoneotes.

Its differences from the other Hyperidea being too important to
allow of its introduction into any of the old families of that tribe, it may
¹be considered the type of a new family:
