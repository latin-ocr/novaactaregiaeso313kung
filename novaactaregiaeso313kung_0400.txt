2 Ρ. T. Cave,

The orystalline forms of several didymium-compounds having been
determined by Mr. O. ΜΟΒΤΟΝ, student in the new university of Stook-
holm, I beg to offer him my best thanks. I have not made any de-
ferminations of the solubility of the oompounds of didymium, as it is
my intention to make a comparative study, later on, of the solubility
of some of the salts of the rare earths.

Oxide of didymium
Di203.

The pure oxide of didymium has an asli-gray colom· and is easily
soluble in aoids.

Peroxide of didymium.

On ignition to redness in the· air the oxide of didymium assumes
a dark brown oolour which disappears on heating to a bright red heat.
MARmNAo, HERMANN and Zsofflsssons have found that this oxide contains
only a small quantity of oxygen more than the oxide of didymium
(032 to O.88 peremit), In the year 1874 FRERICH81) adopted the for-
mule Di203 for the pemxide, supposing the oxide te be DiO. Later,
1878, FRERloHs and SMITH2) give more detailed accounts of their experi-
ments. They then admitted the formula Di203 for the oxide and adopted
the formula Di4‘O9 for the peroxide. This formula requires a large amount
of oxygen (7.1,3 for 100 D2O3). On repeating their experiments 1³) could
not verify their statement, having obtained only O.98 oxygen by heating
the peroxide in a current of hydrogen. Mr. BRAUNER4) also found only
1.22—3.55 oxygen for 100 Di202„ when he repeated the experiments of
