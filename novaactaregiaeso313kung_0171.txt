SAMARIUM. 27

Orthophosphate of samarium
SmPO4.

This phosphate was obtained by dissolving the oxide of sama-
rium in melting metaphosphate of sodium. A topas-coloured glass was
thus produced which on cooling became enamel-like, owing to the formation
of small, but well formed⁷ short prismatic crystals. The mass was trea-
ted with wat-er⁷ the crystals being thus obtained as a heavy crystalline
whitish yellow powder. 'Phe salt is scarcely attacked by boiling nitric
acid. In order to analyse it, the salt was decomposed by fusion with
soda. Some phosphoric acid always remains with the oxide of sama-
rium so it is quite indispensable to dissolve the oxide in nitric acid and
to precipit-ate with oxalic aeid.

O.7840 gram gave O.5591 gram Sm203 and O.3311 gram Mg2P2O7.
O.6114 gram gave O.4354 gram Sm2O3.
O.34OO gram gave 2.5365 gram phosphomolybdate of ammonia.

Di-sodium-orthophosphate gives with nitrate of samarium a bulky
white, and amorphous precipitate which can only be washed with diffi-
culty and easily passes through the filter. When dried it forms white
hard pieces. The precipitate, dried in the air at ordinary temperatum,
gave on analysis:

Ο.4203 gram lost- at 100⁰ Ο.0290 gram and in red-hot Ο.Ο317 gram,
It gave, melted with carbonate of sodium7 O.2494 gram Sm2O3 and O.1760
gram Mg2P2O7.
