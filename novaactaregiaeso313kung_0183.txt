SAMARIUM. 39

curate of samarium

SmCssH4(OH)(CO2)3-l- 6 (at 1000 dried 1) H2O.

Citrio aoid gives with aeetate of samarium a white, bulky, not
crystalline preeipitate. The salt is soluble in ammonia⁷ and the solution
remains clear 011 boiling.

The salt¹ pressed between filter-paper lost on heating to 1000 2148
pereent water corresponding to 5 mol. H2O (calo 2013).

03828 gram salt, dried at 1000, gave by ignition 04877 gr. Sm203.

In percent: 49.03. The formula with 1H2O requires 4874 ρει-00111.

Pion-ate of samarium

smssofiH2<No2½o ψ 81120.

A solution of pierio aoid dissolves the oxide of samarium on boi-
ling. The intensely yellow solution yields aster concentration a heavy
orange coloured oil, which on farther evaporation over oil of vitriol
dissolves. Later on the sal‘t¹ crystallises in small yellow needles‚ which
are easily soluble and melt below 100⁰. When strongly heated the salt
explodes. The salt loses at 100⁰ ll.83 percent H2O or 6 mol. H2O,
calc ll.04.

O.7312 gram of the crystallised salt was dissolved in water and
precipitated with an alooholie solution of oxalic aoid. On ignition O.1308
gram Sm2O3 was obtained.

In peroent: 17:89 Sm2 03, cale 17.79.
