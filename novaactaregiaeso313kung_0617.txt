AMPHIPODA SYNOPIDEA. 3

dedly to the Hyperide, as the structure and development of the eyes,
the structure of the mouth-organs (With the exception of the palps of
the maxillipeds)‚ the form of the uropoda and the telson (especially in
the last two families) a. o.

Probably the new genus Hyperiops·z'3,-lately described by G. O.
SARs¹)‚ is to be placed in this tribe as the type of a new family, Hy-
periopsidae, and I shall preliminarily do so here,v although I do not
know much about the very important characteristics of the mouth-or-
gans, because SARS only mentions, that the niandibles are provided with
palps, similar to those of the Gammarids.

Thus the tribe can conveniently be divided into three families:

1.SYNOP1DAE. 2. TRISOHIZOSTOMATIDAE and 3. HYPERIOPSIDAE.

⁸bifid. Syuopidae.

ι not transformed. Telson

 

The seveuth pair of pereiopoda Χ simple. Trischizostomatidae.

trausformed. Telsou simple. Hyperiopsidae.

The first family.
SYNOPIDAE.

Diagu. The head is triangular, not tumid.

The eyes occupy the upper median part of the head, andare distinctly faceted.
The manclibles are well developed, with a tlirce-jointed palp.
