Dinrmuii. 7

Bromide ef didymium with bromide of zinc
Di2Br3 -1- 3 Zn Br2 -l- 12H2O.

According to Fusmons, and SMITH the bremide of didymium gives
with the bromide of zinc a very deliqvescent double salt, crystallising
in radiated needles, having the composition 2DiBr3-l- 3ZnBr2-l- 36H2O.
These authors say that the salt loses all its water (3l.63 perc.) at 150Ο
and that the anhydrous salt, thus obtained, gave on analysis nearly all
the calculated quantity of bromine. This is very remarkable as hydro-
bromic aoid may be evolved at the same time as the water and it is
scarcely probable that all the water could be lost at 150⁰. I have tried
to get the salt, described by FRERICHs and SMITH, but Ι obtained by slow
evaporating of the solutions of the mixed bromides, over oil of vitriol,
large, well formed, and rhombic tablets so extremely deliquescent, that
they could scarcely be freed from the thick mother-liquor. The salts
obtained from two different crystallisations were analysed.

I. 1.0149 gram was mixed with acetate of sodium, and the zinc
precipitated with H2S. The precipitate was dissolved and precipitated
with Na2COg. The didymium was precipitated with ammonia, and the
solution of the hydroxide in nitric acid precipitated with oxalic acid.
O.1917 gram ZnO and O.1402 gram Dizoa were thus obtained.

II. O.7615 gram was precipitated with nitrate of silver, and the
filtrate, after separation of the excess of silver, treated as in analysis 1.
loo-39 gram Agssr, 0.1440 gram ZnO and O.1037 gram Di203 were obtained.
