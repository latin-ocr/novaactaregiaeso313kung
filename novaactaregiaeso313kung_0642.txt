28 CARL BovALLms,

with ronnded, minute tceth, and provided with 610111, straight bristles 01311-
other kind than those borde1·ing the rest of the metacarpus [Pl. HI, fig. 52].

The third pair [Pl. ΙΙΙ, fig. 53]. Τ116 femur is tolerably broad3
1110 yeme 61101·1; 1116 tibia very long, broad, With some short spines at the
hinder lower corner. The carpus is ovate, short, scarcely half as long 36
1110 femur. The metacarpus is long, as long as the tibia, narrOW, finely
serratcd along the hinder margin. The dactylus equals a third of 1116
length of the metacarpns3 it is not very curved‚ finely serrated along
the hinder margin.

The fourth pair [Pl. ΙΙΙ, fig. 54] The femur is longer than broad,
611100111; 1116 glemu is 611011, 1116 tibia is long and unusually broad, broader
than half its length (9: 15), with some minute spines along the hinder
margin, pointing to the state in Hyperiopsis; the tibia equ-als the
length of the femur. The carpus is ovate, half as long as the tibia.
The vzetaearpus and dactylus are similar to those of the preceding pair,
the dactylus only a little longer [Pl. ΙΙΙ, fig. 55].

The fifth pair [Pl. ΙΙΙ, fig. 56]. Τ116 femur is broad, laminar, the
hinder part deeply produced downwards, the hinder margin straight3
the yeme smalh the tibia broad, provided With minute spines along
the anterior and posterior margins3 the carpus is only a little shorter
than the tibia, serrated at the anterior margin, with two small spines.
The metacarpus 16 36 long as the carpus; the dactylus longer than half
the metacarpus, both serrated along the anterior margins.

The sim-tlt pair [Pl. III, fig. 57]. The femur is broad, laminar, the
hinder part not so deeply produced as in the preceding pair, the an—
terior and posterior margins rounded; at the lower anterior corner there
are some strong bristleS. The tibia 16 narrower than in the preceding
pair, with the same armature. The carpus is as long as the tibia,
the metaearpus a· little shorter3 the dactylus half as long 36 the preced-
ing joint3 all 111166 joints serrated along the anterior margins.

The sevemlt pair [Pl. HI, fig. 58] are a little longer than the fifth
and sixth pairs3 the femzcr has the anterior margin straight3 the follow-
ing joints are similar to those of the sixth pair.

The pleon. The seglnents are large, subequal, tolerably deep; the
flanlzs of the segments are rounded, with a slight angnlation inferiorly.
The pleon is as long as the 11161 four segments of the perei0n3 the sur-
sace 16 smooth and hard as in the pereion.

The plcopoda [Pl. ΙΙΙ, fig. 59] consist of 3 thick peduncle and
two long, articulated flagella, bordered with long, plumose hairs. The
