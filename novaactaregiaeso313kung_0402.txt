the oxygen by dissolving the perexide in a mixture of sulphuric aeid
and fermus-ammonia sulphate aud titrating the unoxidised ferrous salt.
Three different experimeuts gave for 100 Di2O3 only O.74‚ O.86 and Ο.90
parts oxygeu, This method is7 I believe, very exact. I have used it to
determine the oxygen in peroxide of hydrogen, and I obtained exactly
the same result as that arrived at by determining the peroxyde of hy-
drogen with permanganate of petasii, which is a very exact method.

I conclude from my experiments that the loss by ignition of the
peroxide is either occluded oxygen or is occasioned by †he presence of
small quantities of basio intrate, which have esca-ped decomposition. It
is not possible to calculate a probable formula for the peroxide, prepa-
red on the dry way.

Ι then tried to obtain the peroxyde by mean of peroxyde of hy-v
drogen. The latter Was obtained from Mr. TROMMsDORFF in Erfurt and
was of great purity.

The cold solution of the nitrate of didymium was mixed with a
much more than sufficient quantity of the peroxyde of hydrogen and a
solution of pure caustic potash added. A gelatinous precipitate‚ in all
respects resembling the hydroxyde of didymium, was thrown down3
after a short time an abundant disengagement of oxygen commenced.
The precipitat-e was rapidly and completely washed in darkness ‚and at
ordinary temperature and immediately subjected to analysis. The ma-
terial used for the experiments 1-4 was obtained in the above manner.
For the experiments 5—ss the peroxyde was prepared from sulphate of
didymium. The oxygen was determined by mixing the peroxyde with a
known‘ weight of ammonium serrous sulphate and free sulphuric aeid,
the unoxidised ferrous sulphate being then determined by titi-ation with
permanganate. The didymium was afterwards precipitated with oxalic
aeid and the oxalate ignited. The following results were obtained:
