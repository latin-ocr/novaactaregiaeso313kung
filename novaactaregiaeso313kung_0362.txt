8 CARL BovALLlus,

lar base of the globe, at the under-side of the body, is formed and bor-
dered by the head and the six first pereional segments3 the sixth seg-
ment forms the posterior bordei* of it, but is not infiated and does
not participate in the forming of the globe.

The firm pair of pereiopocla [= gnathopoda, Spence Bate] [Pl. ΙΙΙ.
fig. 21]. Τ110 femur is broad, nearly ovate, With some hairs at the
lower, hinder corner3 it is a little more than twice as long as broad
(45: 19). The yeme is short, scarcely a fourth of the length of the fe-
mur, with some long 113115 at the hinder margin. The tibia, about as
long as the preceding joint, is bordered with long hairs at the under-mar-
gin. The carpus equ-als three fifths of the length of the femur, and is
slender, linear, richly provided with hairs at the hinder margin. The
metamrpzw is shorter than the preceding joint UO: 13), beset all around
with slender hairs3 the tip projecting into a short tooth on the anterior
side of the dactylus. The dactylus is straight, very delicate, equalling
only a fourth of the length of the metacarpus.

The second pair of pereiopoda [z gnathopoda, Spence Bate] [Pl.
III. fig. 22] The epimeml is long, with rounded corners, not occupying

the whole segment. The famur is laminar, narrower than the femur of 1

the first pair, thrice as long as broad, with a few hairs at the lower
hindei· corner. The yeme and tibia as in the preceding pair. The carpus
is shorter than half of the femur, with only a few hairs at the lower
end. The meterem-[ms 15 longer than the carpus (62 5), beset with hairs,
the tip projecting into a tooth as in the first pair. The dactylus is
short and nearly straight, it equals only a sixth of the length of the
preceding joint. The branelez’al saelc 15 half as long as the leg, the
ovifyerozcs lamella equals nearly the whole length of the leg.

The third pair of pereiopocla [Pl. ΠΙ. fig. 23] are the longest of all.
The epimeral 15 very large, deep, rounded, not occupying the whole
length of the segment. The femur is long and narrOW, four times as
long as broad, without hairs or bristles; it 15 longer than the three fel-
lowing, the lower part is a little broader than the upper. The glemu 15
short and smooth; the tibia 15 long and broad, coarsely serrated at the
hinder margin and carrying some short bristles. The carpus 15 longer
than the preceding joint (ὃς 5); it carries three. bristles and some hairs
at the hindei· margin. The metaeaupus· is very slender, shorter than the
carpus (11: 16), provided with some very short bristles; in the interior
of the joint is a long 111111 gland, containing a fine granular¹ substance,
but without visible duetus. The branclu'al sack 15 half as long as the leg,
the oviyerous lamella is only a. third shorter than the leg [Pl. ΙΠ. fig. 25].
