short, plumose hairs at the lower end. The dactylus is a little shorter
than the metacarpus (8: 11), pedunculated‚ of the same shape as in the
preceding pair.

The fifth pair [Pl. I, fig. 15]. The femur is rounded, nearly cir-
cular, a little longer than broad (132 11), the hinder margin is quite
smooth, the anterior carrying three short hairs. The yeme is short, the
tibia broad, three times longer than the genu, the hinder margin feebly
curved, with a short spine at the lower corner⁷ the anterior margin
straight with 3—4 spines. The carpus equals the tibia in length, and is
linear, with 4—5 spines at the anterior margin. The metacarpus is longer
and narrower, linear, with two pairs of spines on the anterior, and a simple
hair at the posterior margin3 at each of the lower corners there is a long,
straight spine. The dactylus is very long, nearly straight, sharp-pointed,
not pedunculated, only a little shorter than the metacarpus (192 23).

The sioetlz pair [Pl. I, fig. 16] are longer than the fifth but of the >
same structure. The femur is longer than broad (29: 23), and carries a spine
at the lower anterior corner. The metaeavpus is quite as long as the
femur, with four pairs of spines along the anterior margin, the last
pair at the lower corner, two short spines at the hinder margin, and a
longer one at the lower hinder corner. The dactylus is only a little
shorter than the metacarpus [111 14], straight, sharp.

The sevevztlt pair [Pl. I, fig. 17] are about a fifth shorter than the
sixth; the femur is broad, laminar, posteriorly produced downwards‚ the
projectior] reaching nearly to the middle of the tibia3 the hinder margin
is curved, smooth, the anterior margin is feebly curved, nearly straight.
The yeme is short; the tibia of the same form as in the two preceding
pairs, but carrying only two spines at the lower corners. The carpus
is of the length of the tibia⁷ with three or four spines along the an-
terior margin and two on the posterior. The metaearpus is longer and
narrower, bnt not equalling the femur in length3 it carries four single
spines along the anterior margin and one on the posterior. At the
lower, hinder corner there are two straight spines. The dactylus is
straight, long, sharp, but does not fully equal two thirds of the length
of the metacarpus (15: 24).

The pleon. The segments are large, equal in length, each as long
as the sixth pereional segment. The flanks of the segments reach tole-
rably deep, the under margin is rounded, they end posteriorly in a not
very sharp angle. The pleon equ-als the first five pereional segments
together in length.
