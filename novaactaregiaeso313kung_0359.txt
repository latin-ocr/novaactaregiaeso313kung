MlMONEc'rEs, A REMARKABLE GENUS OF AMPHiPODA HrPERinizA. 5

The middle part of the ganglion seems to be the cptical part
of the nervous mass, as fine slender nerves issue from it forwards to 1116
foremost ocelli. The fine nerves going to the other ocelli seem to 31166
from the 6011111116611131 cords, connecting the cephalic ganglion with the
infraoesophagial ganglion, but perhaps this only seems to 116 60, the
fibres really coming in a stem or cable fron] the central part of the
ganglion and branching off successively one after the other from the
common stem along the side of 1116 601111111661116. However this may 116,
it is certain that each of these slender 11611766 111116 10 0116 of the ocelli
and enters it, being a little thicker or more swollen at the point of 611-
trance. The number of such ocelli is from eight 10 1611 011 63611 side
of the head. The third or posterior pair of lobes are nearly as large as
the anterior, ancl directed obliquely forwards. A portion of the nerve
originating from the 10116 runs to the peduncle of the superior antennae,
another portion goes to the region of the mouth. The principal nei-ves
of the mouth come however from the infraoesophagial and the first pe-
reional ganglion.

The commissural cords, connecting the cephalic and the infraoeso-
phagial ganglia, are very stout ancl thick. The infraoesophagial gang-
lion is coalesced with the first ganglion of the ventral chain. From
this ganglion, which is not divided longitudinally in the middle 11110 two
portions, arise two pairs of nerves; the first pair run to the mouth,
the second upwards to the interior of the head. From its hinder part
issue the two commissural cords, widely separated at their base, but
close together at their entrance into the ganglion of the first pereional
segment. This ganglion, as well as the five next following ones, is 60111-
posed of two distinct ganglia, pressed against each other, but- not 603-
lesced. The inter-ganglia] parts of the chain, or the 6011111116611131 cords,
are more widely separated. The two lateral ganglia of 1116 6617611111 pe-
reional segment are totally fused together, 60 as to form 0116 1161170116
mass. From every one of the seven ganglia, which form the 1161170116
chain of the pereion, two pairs of strong nerves issue, the anterior pair
running to the legs and gills, the posterior upwards to the organs of
circulation. From these last nerves branches run up to the walls of the
globular bladder, but only in the second, third, and fourth segments.
From the commissura] cords, between each pair of ganglia, long slender
nerves branch off, one on each side; they run to the sides of the cor-
responding segment. The ganglionic chain continues backwards in the
pleon with three pairs of large ganglia, but, as in the last pereionial
