The numbers found do not agree sufficienty well with those obtained by
calculation, so that there may be some doubt as to the exact amount
of water.

Platinocyanate of samarium

This eornpound was obtained by slowly ewporating, over 0ss of
vitriol, the solution result-ing from the double decomposition of platino-
cyanide of barium and sulphate of samarium. The compound forms
beautiful tolerably large prisms which appear yellow by transmitted and
blue by reflected light. It is stable in the air⁷ and looses at 110Ο 1033
percent- H2O or 14 mol. (= 16.57).

Sulphocyanate of samarium
Sm(ONS)3 -l- 6H2O.

A solution of the oxide in sulphocyanic aoid was evaporated over
oil of vitriol. Slender, yellow, and highly deliquescent ueadles were de-
posited from the syrupy solution. The salt was pressed between filter-
paper as rapidly as possible and analysed.
