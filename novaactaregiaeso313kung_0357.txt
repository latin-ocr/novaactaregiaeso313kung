Mnuomzerss, A REMARKABLE Genus or AMPfflPonA HYPERIDEA. 3

The speeimens examined have been distributed into three new
species, easily distinguished from one another, as shown by the follow—
ing dia-gram.

pereiopoda only a little shorter than
half the diameter of the globe.

For the more detailed description Ι have chosen Minionectes
Loveni, because I have some larger specimens of it at my disposal.

1. Mimonectes hevelli, n. sp.

The name in honour of Professor SVEN Loviax.

The ylobe is formed by the head and the five first pereional
segments. ⁴

The head is nearly four times higher than long.

The upper antennae are longer than the head, their margins are
serrated. Α

The lower antennce are four—jointed.

The sixtlz and seventlz pereional seyments are comparat-ively com-
pressed, not infiated.

The third pair of pereiopoda are nearly as long as half the dia-
meter of the globe.

The first pair of uropocla do not reaeh to the end of the second pair.

The most striking characteristic of the animal is that Which cha-
racterises the whole genus, viz. the enormous development of the head
