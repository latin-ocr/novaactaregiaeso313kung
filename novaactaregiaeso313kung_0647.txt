Ampfflpom Srmpmm. 33

As I have not got any specimen at my disposal for examinaston,
the above quoted characteristics ure extracted from the description of
Professor SARS (l. c.); for further particulare I refer to his sletailed de-
scription, mentioning here only some few important facts.

The egles are without any traee os refractive elements or distinctly
developed pigment.

The second-ary flagellum of the first pair of autenm& is about as
long as the first joint of the true flagellum3 its first joint is the longest.

The second pair of antennae are shorter and more slender than the
first, the flagellum is shorter than the peduncle.

The femora of the last three pairs of pereiopoda are slender‚ not
lamelliform3 the following part of the last. pair is very elongate.

The first two pairs of w’opocla are long⁷ slender7 two-articulate.
This is a very peculiar form of uropoda, not occurrhrg, as far as I know,
in the tribe of Amphipoda Hyperiidea.

»One example of this remarkable Amphipod was taken, on the
first cruise of the Expeditior]⁷ off the Norwegian coast (Stat. 54>1) at a
depth of 600 fathoms. Another (defective) specimen was subsequently
extracted from the stomach of the remarkable deep-sea fish, Rhodich-
thys regina, COLLETT‚ brought up at Stat. 297²), from a depth of 1280
fathoms.» (G. O. SARs l. c. p. 233).
