Anhydrometaphosphate of samarium
Sm2O3 512205.

If the anhydrous and finely powdered sulphate of samarium be>
added to fused metaphosphoric aeid, it dissolves easily, fumes of sul-
phuric acid being given of. The residue soon becomes white owing to
the formation of small crystals. After oooling⁷ the mass was treated
with water which dissolved the phosphoric aoid and left a heavy
yellowish—white powder of small glittering crystals, insoluble in water
and in boiling nitrio acid. The crystals were very well developped·
They represent a new series of phosphates. Didymium gives an exactly
analogous phosphate.

O.ss425 gram was fused with soda and the fused mass treated wit-h
water. The solution was precipitated with magnesia-mixture and the
residue dissolved in nitrio aoid and precipited with oxalic aoid. By
igniting the oxalate O.215O gram Sm2O3 was obtained. The filtrate fron]
the oxalate contained phosphoric aeid, which was precipitated as ani-
monium-n]agnesium-phosphate. Altogether O-6678 gram Mg2P2,O7 was
obtained ⁸

O.9672 gram gave O.3195 gram Sm203 and 10138 gran] Mg2P2O7.
