FREmcns and SM1TH. Mr. BRAUNER then tried heating the basio niti-ate
of didyniium to incipient redness in a. current of oxygen. On determi-
ning the oxygen as the loss by strong ignition he found as a mean of
9 closely agreeing experiments 9.44 oxygen for 100 Di203⁷ which very
nearly corresponds to the formula Di205. However the atoniic weight
of the didymium in the oxide, used by BRAUNER, was 146.ss which indi-
cates that the oxide, regarded by BRAUNER as pure, really contained a
large percentage of samarium, the atomio weight of didyinium being
1423 and that. of samarium 150. I found it therefore necessary to re-
peat BRAUNERs experiments with the purest didymia I had. I heated the
basio nitrate in a platinum-basin till the red vapours ceased to be given
off. The residue was afterwards powdered‚ heated again, and lastly
heated in a current of oxygen to incipient redness. The material used
for experiments l and 2 were obtained in this manner. In all the other
cases Ι followed the description given by Mr. BRAUNER exactly.
My experiments are as follow:

The loss on ignition was thus considerably less than in BRAUNERS
experiments. Although Ι made 10 experiments Ι could not get more
than 502 in any single experiment.

One may perhaps conclude that the reason for this difference is
that the material used by BRAUNER contained samarium⁷ but it cannot
be so. In fact I am unable to suggest a satisfactory explanation. If
the loss on ignition be considered peroxide-oxygen my experiments tend
to the formula DiO2, which requires 482 parts of oxygen to 100 Di2O3.

Stil] Ι am very much inclined to doubt that the loss by ignition
is due to oxygen in chemical combination. Ι have tried to determine
