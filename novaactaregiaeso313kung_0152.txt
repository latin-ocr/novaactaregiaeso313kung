sidering that oxygen was given off immediately after the precipitation
and that products of this kind are very liable to lose oxygen, one may
with some probability give preference to the formula R205. Still it is
a question, which cannot be answered, whether these products are really
peroxides and not a kind of hydrate containing H2O27 in some manner
analogous to the compounds of Bao„ Na2O2 etc. with H2O2‚ which were
discovered by SonoNE.

Sulphide of samarium.

Oxide of samarium was ignited in a current of hydrogen, satu-
rated with vapours of bisulphide of carbon. It was blackened with
carbon⁷ but its weight was very slightly increased, so that it may be
concluded that the oxide of samarium is not attacked by bisulphide of
carbon at a red beat.

Fluoride of samarium

2 Sin F13 -l- H2 O.

Hydrofluoric aoid produces with solutions of the salts of sama-
rium a whitish, transparent, voluminous⁷ and non-crystalline precipitate
which⁷ on heating the solution⁷ settles down as a heavy powder in a
very fine state of division. The fluoride is not soluble in dilute acids.

I. 1.0888 gram of the fluoricle, dried at 1100, gave with sulphuric
aeid l.5026 gram Sm23SO4.

Il. 20857 gram, dried at 100⁰, gave 28801 gram Sm2ssSO4.

In percent:

It seems as if a little of the water were lost at 100⁰, as the
analyses of two different preparations gave one percent Sm too much.
This is also the ease with the fiuorides of the other cerium· and yttrium-
metals.
