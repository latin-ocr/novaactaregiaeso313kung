O.6·213 grani was fused with a mixture of carbon-<ite of sodium and
potassium and the fused mass treated with water. The solution, filtered
from insoluble residue, gave 05236 gram Mg2P2O7. The insoluble re-
sidue was dissolved in nitrio aeid and the didymium precipit-cited with
oxalie aoid. The Di203 obtained by ignit-ion of the oxalate weighed
Ο.1991 gram. The filtrate fron] the oxalate of didymiuni gave Ο.1364
grani Mg2P2O7‚ the tota-l Mg2P2O⁷ being therefore O-6600 gram.

0403& gran] gave O.1284 grani Di203.

Car-bonate of didymium
Di23003 ·†- 8H2O.

A vessel in which some basio niti-ate of didymium was suspended
in a solution of nitrate of didyniium7 containing some nitrate of ammonium,
was left for several months exposed to the air at a temperature from
100—--15⁰. By this time tolerably large tabular crystals (4 to 5 millim.
in diameter> and scales of naereous lustre and violet eolour had been
deposited. They were washed free fron] the basio nitrate and were
found to oonsist of carbonate of didymium.

&4274 grani, pressed between filter-paper, were lieated and left
O.2331 gram Di203.

0503ss gram were heated together with biehroniate of potash in a
current of dry air and gave O.1194 gran] H2O and Ο.1Ο83 grani CO2.
